abstract = {We present a self-contained introduction to the classical theory of spacetime and fields. This exposition is based on the most general principles: the principle of general covariance (relativity) and the principle of least action. The order of the exposition is: 1. Spacetime (principle of general covariance and tensors, affine connection, curvature, metric, tetrad and spin connection, Lorentz group, spinors); 2. Fields (principle of least action, action for gravitational field, matter, symmetries and conservation laws, gravitational field equations, spinor fields, electromagnetic field, action for particles). In this order, a particle is a special case of a field existing in spacetime, and classical mechanics can be derived from field theory.},

@article{Friedrich1985,
abstract = {It is shown that Einstein's vacuum field equations (respectively the conformal vacuum field equations) in a frame formalism imply a symmetric hyperbolic system of ``reduced'' propagation equations for any choice of coordinate system and frame field (and conformal factor). Certain freely specifiable ``gauge source'' functions occurring in the reduced equations reflect the choice of gauge. Together with the initial data they determine the gauge uniquely. Their choice does not affect the isometry class (conformal class) of a solution of an initial value problem. By the same method symmetric hyperbolic propagation equations are obtained from other gauge field equations, irrespective of the gauge. Using the concept of source functions one finds that Einstein's field equation, considered as second order equations for the metric coefficients, are of wave equation type in any coordinate system.},

abstract = {Exponential Runge-Kutta methods constitute efficient integrators for semilinear stiff problems. So far, however, explicit exponential Runge-Kutta methods are available in the literature up to order 4 only. The aim of this paper is to construct a fifth-order method. For this purpose, we make use of a novel approach to derive the stiff order conditions for high-order exponential methods. This allows us to obtain the conditions for a method of order 5 in an elegant way. After stating the conditions, we first show that there does not exist an explicit exponential Runge-Kutta method of order 5 with less than or equal to 6 stages. Then, we construct a fifth-order method with 8 stages and prove its convergence for semilinear parabolic problems. Finally, a numerical example is given that illustrates our convergence bound. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wu2017a,
abstract = {The apparent gas permeability of the porous medium is an important parameter in the prediction of unconventional gas production, which was first investigated systematically by Klinkenberg in 1941 and found to increase with the reciprocal mean gas pressure (or equivalently, the Knudsen number). Although the underlying rarefaction effects are well-known, the reason that the correction factor in Klinkenberg's famous equation decreases when the Knudsen number increases has not been fully understood. Most of the studies idealize the porous medium as a bundle of straight cylindrical tubes, however, according to the gas kinetic theory, this only results in an increase of the correction factor with the Knudsen number, which clearly contradicts Klinkenberg's experimental observations. Here, by solving the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook equation in simplified (but not simple) porous media, we identify, for the first time, two key factors that can explain Klinkenberg's experimental results: the tortuous flow path and the non-unitary tangential momentum accommodation coefficient for the gas-surface interaction. Moreover, we find that Klinkenberg's results can only be observed when the ratio between the apparent and intrinsic permeabilities is {\$}\backslashlesssim30{\$}; at large ratios (or Knudsen numbers) the correction factor increases with the Knudsen number. Our numerical results could also serve as benchmarking cases to assess the accuracy of macroscopic models and/or numerical schemes for the modeling/simulation of rarefied gas flows in complex geometries over a wide range of gas rarefaction.},

abstract = {Strongly interacting, dynamically disordered and with no small parameter, liquids took a theoretical status between gases and solids. We review different approaches to liquids and propose that liquids do not need classifying in terms of their proximity to gases and solids. Instead, they are a unique system in their own class with a notably mixed dynamical state in contrast to pure dynamical states of solids and gases. We start with explaining how the first-principles approach to liquids is an intractable, exponentially complex problem of coupled non-linear oscillators with bifurcations. This is followed by a reduction of the problem based on liquid relaxation time {\$}\backslashtau{\$} representing non-perturbative treatment of strong interactions. On the basis of {\$}\backslashtau{\$}, solid-like high-frequency modes are predicted and we review related recent experiments. We demonstrate how these modes can be derived by generalizing either hydrodynamic or elasticity equations. We comment on the historical trend to approach liquids using hydrodynamics and compare it to an alternative solid-like approach. We subsequently discuss how collective modes evolve with temperature and how this affects liquid energy and other properties such as fast sound. Here, our emphasis is on real, rather than model, liquids. Highlighting the dominant role of high-frequency modes for liquid energy, we review a wide range of liquids: subcritical low-viscous liquids, supercritical state with two different dynamical and thermodynamic regimes separated by the Frenkel line, highly-viscous liquids and liquid-glass transition. We also discuss liquid-liquid phase transitions where the solid-like properties of liquids have become further apparent. We then discuss gas-like and solid-like approaches to quantum liquids and persisting theoretical problems. We list areas where interesting insights may appear and continue the extraordinary liquid story.},

By doing so, common features of GENERIC and extended irreversible thermodynamics are revealed, and a new set of equations for relativistic imperfect fluids is formulated. These equations are compared to the classical first-order theory of Eckart, the second-order theory of Israel, and the equations derived by relativistic kinetic theory. The GENERIC generators of reversible and irreversible dynamics, energy and entropy, occur as the time components of the energy–momentum tensor and the entropy current four-vector, respectively.},

abstract = {Gradient-enhanced damage models and phase-field models are seemingly very disparate approaches to fracture. Whereas gradient-enhanced damage models find their roots in damage mechanics, which is a smeared approach from the onset, and gradients were added to restore well-posedness beyond a critical strain level, the phase-field approach to brittle fracture departs from a discontinuous description of failure, where the distribution function is regularised, leading to the inclusion of spatial gradients as well. Herein, we will consider both approaches, and discuss their similarities and differences. The averaging (diffusion) equations for the averaging field and the phase-field will be compared, and it is shown that the diffusion equation for the phase-field can be conceived as a special case of the averaging equation of a gradient-damage model where the damage is averaged. Further, the role of the driving force is examined, and it is shown that subtle differences in the degradation functions commonly adopted in damage and phase-field approaches are key to the observation that, different from damage mechanics, the fracture process zone does not broaden in the wake of the crack tip.},

We present an improved translational gauge theory of dislocations including the dislocation density tensor and the dislocation current tensor. The invariance of the variational principle under the continuous group of transformations is studied. Through Lie's-infinitesimal invariance criterion we obtain conserved translational and rotational currents for the total Lagrangian made up of an elastic and dislocation part. We calculate the broken scaling current. Looking only on one part of the whole system, the conservation laws are changed into balance laws. Because of the lack of translational, rotational and dilatation invariance for each part, a configurational force, moment and power appears. The corresponding J, L and M integrals are obtained. Only isotropic and homogeneous materials are considered and we restrict ourselves to a linear theory. We choose constitutive laws for the most general linear form of material isotropy. Also we give the conservation and balance laws corresponding to the gauge symmetry and the addition of solutions. From the addition of solutions we derive a reciprocity theorem for the gauge theory of dislocations. Also, we derive the conservation laws for stress-free states of dislocations.},

abstract = {The discovery of photonic crystals 30 years ago in conjunction with research advances in plasmonics and metamaterials, has inspired the concept of decameter scale metasurfaces, coined seismic metamaterials for an enhanced control of surface (Love and Rayleigh) and bulk (shear and pressure) elastodynamic waves. These powerful mathematical tools of coordinate transforms, effective medium and Floquet-Bloch theories which have revolutionized nanophotonics, can be translated in the language of civil engineering and geophysics. Experiments on seismic metamaterials made of buried elements in the soil demonstrate that the fore mentioned tools make a possible novel description of complex phenomena of soil-structure interaction during a seismic disturbance. But the concepts are already moving to more futuristic concepts and the same notions developed for structured soils are now used to examine the effects of buildings viewed as above surface resonators in megastructures such as metacities. But this perspective of future should not make us forget the heritage of the ancient peoples. Indeed, we finally point out the striking similarity between an invisible cloak design and the architecture of some ancient megastructures as the antique Gallo-Roman theaters and amphitheatres.},

abstract = {We present a new family of high order accurate fully discrete one-step Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes on moving unstructured meshes for the solution of nonlinear hyperbolic PDE in multiple space dimensions, which may also include parabolic terms in order to model dissipative transport processes. High order piecewise polynomials are adopted to represent the discrete solution at each time level and within each spatial control volume of the computational grid, while high order of accuracy in time is achieved by the ADER approach. In our algorithm the spatial mesh configuration can be defined in two different ways: either by an isoparametric approach that generates curved control volumes, or by a piecewise linear decomposition of each spatial control volume into simplex sub-elements. Our numerical method belongs to the category of direct Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) schemes, where a space-time conservation formulation of the governing PDE system is considered and which already takes into account the new grid geometry directly during the computation of the numerical fluxes. Our new Lagrangian-type DG scheme adopts the novel a posteriori sub-cell finite volume limiter method, in which the validity of the candidate solution produced in each cell by an unlimited ADER-DG scheme is verified against a set of physical and numerical detection criteria. Those cells which do not satisfy all of the above criteria are flagged as troubled cells and are recomputed with a second order TVD finite volume scheme. The numerical convergence rates of the new ALE ADER-DG schemes are studied up to fourth order in space and time and several test problems are simulated. Finally, an application inspired by Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) type flows is considered by solving the Euler equations and the PDE of viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (VRMHD).},

abstract = {This paper gives details of new data on neutralized Carbopol 940 dispersions. Appropriate techniques have been used to characterize the physical properties of the bulk gel and inter-phase slip at the wall. Previously published data are analysed and used wherever possible. Terminology and measurement difficulties are also addressed. The structure of Carbopol dispersions can be described in terms of polydisperse glasses made of individual swollen hydrophylic elastic sponges. They display elastoplasticity, and significant dissipation both below and above their yield stress. Hardly any creep was observed over 10 months of experiments. Scaling laws are proposed for Carbopol mechanical properties as a function of concentration. Carbopol behaviour varies with the value of concentration, and in particular when comparing percolation concentration with close-packing concentration. Constitutive equations for bulk shear stresses and for friction slip at the wall can be deduced from contact mechanics which fit rheometry data and scaling laws. Herschel-Bulkley constitutive equations may be used by ignoring elasticity, normal shear stresses and transients. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We discuss a bent-ray ultrasound tomography algorithm with total-variation (TV) regularization. We have applied this algorithm to 61 in vivo breast datasets collected with our in-house clinical prototype for imaging sound-speed distributions in the breast. Our analysis showed that TV regularization could preserve sharper lesion edges than the classic Tikhonov regularization. Furthermore, the image quality of our TV bent-ray sound-speed tomograms was superior to that of the straight-ray counterparts for all types of breasts within BI-RADS density categories 1 through 4. Our analysis showed that the improvements for average sharpness (in the unit of (m {\textperiodcentered} s)-1) of lesion edges in our TV bent-ray tomograms are between 2.1 to 3.4-fold compared with the straight ray tomograms. Reconstructed sound-speed tomograms illustrated that our algorithm could successfully image fatty and glandular tissues within the breast. We calculated the mean sound-speed values for fatty tissue and breast parenchyma as 1422 ± 9 m/s (mean ± SD) and1487 ± 21 m/s, respectively. Based on 32 lesions in a cohort of 61 patients, we also found that the mean sound-speed for malignant breast lesions (1548 ± 17 m/s) was higher, on average, than that of benign ones (1513 ± 27 m/s) (one-sided p {\textless} 0.001). These results suggest that, clinically, sound-speed tomograms can be used to assess breast density (and therefore, breast cancer risk), as well as detect and help differentiate breast lesions. Finally, our sound-speed tomograms may also be a useful tool to monitor the clinical response of breast cancer patients to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.

abstract = {While there is currently a lot of enthusiasm about “big data”, useful data is usually “small” and expensive to acquire. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial differential equations from small data. In particular, we introduce hidden physics models, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier–Stokes, Schr{\"{o}}dinger, Kuramoto–Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.},

Proc. R. Soc. A 471: 20150415. http://dx. In order to found continuum mechanics, two different postulations have been used. The first, introduced by Lagrange and Piola, starts by postulating how the work expended by internal interactions in a body depends on the virtual velocity field and its gradients. Then, by using the divergence theorem, a representation theorem is found for the volume and contact interactions which can be exerted at the boundary of the considered body. This method assumes an a priori notion of internal work, regards stress tensors as dual of virtual displacements and their gradients, deduces the concept of contact interactions and produces their representation in terms of stresses using integration by parts. The second method, conceived by Cauchy and based on the celebrated tetrahedron argument, starts by postulating the type of contact interactions which can be exerted on the boundary of every (suitably) regular part of a body. Then it proceeds by proving the existence of stress tensors from a balance-type postulate. In this paper, we review some relevant literature on the subject, discussing how the two postulations can be reconciled in the case of higher gradient theories. Finally, we underline the importance of the concept of contact surface, edge and wedge s-order forces.},

We argue that in this case the most general Lagrangian at the first order of perturbations is given by the linear combination of quadratic invariants and hence coincide with the well-known new general relativity model. We derive the linearized field equations and analyze them using the principal polynomial and the Newman-Penrose formalism. We demonstrate that all gravitational waves modes propagate at the speed of light and there are up to six possible polarizations. We show that two tensorial modes of general relativity are always present and the number of extra polarizations depends on the free parameters of the new general relativity model.},

abstract = {Fully non-linear equations of motion for dissipative general relativistic fluids can be obtained from an action principle involving the explicit use of lower dimensional matter spaces. More traditional strategies for incorporating dissipation-like the famous Mueller-Israel-Stewart model-are based on expansions away from equilibrium defined, in part, by the laws of thermodynamics. The goal here is to build a formalism to facilitate comparison of the action-based results with those based on the traditional approach. The first step of the process is to use the action-based approach itself to build self-consistent notions of equilibrium. Next, first-order deviations are developed directly on the matter spaces, which motivates the latter as the natural arena for the underlying thermodynamics. Finally, we identify the dissipation terms of the action-based model with first-order "thermodynamic" fluxes, on which the traditional models are built. A simple application of a single viscous fluid is considered. The description is developed in a general setting so that the formalism can be used to describe more complicated systems, for which causal and stable models are not yet available. Finally, even though our expansions are halted at first order, we sketch out how a causal response can be implemented with telegraph-type equations.},

In near-equilibrium we recover the previous results. The correspondence between the ET 6-field theory and Meixner's theory of relaxation processes is discovered. The internal variable and the non-equilibrium temperature in Meixner's theory are expressed in terms of the quantities of the ET 6-field theory, in particular, the dynamic pressure. As an example, we present the cases of a rarefied polyatomic gas and study the monatomic-gas limit where the system converges to the Euler system of a perfect fluid.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Cambridge University Press. The $\mu$(I)-rheology was recently proposed as a potential candidate to model the incompressible flow of frictional grains in the dense inertial regime. However, this rheology was shown to be ill-posed in the mathematical sense for a large range of parameters, notably in the low and large inertial number limits (Barker et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 779, 2015, pp. 794-818). In this rapid communication, we extend the stability analysis of Barker et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 779, 2015, pp. 794-818) to compressible flows. We show that compressibility regularizes the equations, making the problem well-posed for all parameters, with the condition that sufficient dissipation be associated with volume changes. In addition to the usual Coulomb shear friction coefficient $\mu$, we introduce a bulk friction coefficient $\mu$b, associated with volume changes and show that the problem is well-posed if $\mu$b {\textgreater} 1 - 7$\mu$=6. Moreover, we show that the ill-posed domain defined by Barker et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 779, 2015, pp. 794-818) transforms into a domain where the flow is unstable but remains well-posed when compressibility is taken into account. These results suggest the importance of taking into account dynamic compressibility for the modelling of dense granular flows and open new perspectives to investigate the emission and propagation of acoustic waves inside these flows.},

@article{Bloch2005a,
abstract = {Nonholonomic systems are, roughly speaking, me- chanical systems with constraints on their veloc- ity that are not derivable from position constraints. They arise, for instance, in mechanical systems that have rolling contact (for example, the rolling of wheels without slipping) or certain kinds of slid- ing contact (such as the sliding of skates). They are a remarkable generalization of classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems in which one allows po- sition constraints only. There are some fascinating differences between nonholonomic systems and classical Hamiltonian or Lagrangian systems. Among other things: non- holonomic systems are nonvariational—they arise from the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle and not from Hamilton's principle; whereas energy is pre- served for nonholonomic systems, momentum is not always preserved for systems with symmetry (i.e., there is nontrivial dynamics associated with the nonholonomic generalization of Noether's theorem); nonholonomic systems are almost Pois- son but not Poisson (i.e., there is a bracket that to- gether with the energy on the phase space defines the motion, but the bracket generally does not sat- isfy the Jacobi identity); and finally, unlike the Hamiltonian setting, volume may not be preserved in the phase space, leading to interesting asymp- totic stability in some cases, despite energy con- servation. The purpose of this article is to engage the reader's interest by highlighting some of these differences along with some current research in the area. There has been some confusion in the liter- ature for quite some time over issues such as the variational character of nonholonomic systems, so it is appropriate that we begin with a brief review of the history of the subject.},

This approach captures the statistical evolution of dislocation structures and grain fragmentation at the bonding interface when sufficient boundary conditions pertaining to the Ultrasonic Consolidation (UC) process are prescribed. The hardening is incorporated using statistically stored and geometrically necessary dislocation densities (SSDs and GNDs), which are dislocation analogs of isotropic and kinematic hardening, respectively. Since the macroscopic global boundary conditions during UC involves cyclic sinosuidal simple shear loading along with constant normal pressure, the cross slip mechanism has been included in the evolution equation for SSDs. The inclusion of cross slip promotes slip irreversibility, dislocation storage, and hence, cyclic hardening during the UC. The GND considers strain-gradient and thus renders the model size-dependent. The model is calibrated using experimental data from iv published refereed literature for simple shear deformation of single crystalline pure aluminum alloy and uniaxial tension of polycrystalline Aluminum 3003-H18 alloy. The model also incorporates various local and global effects such as (1) friction, (2) thermal softening, (3) acoustic softening, (4) surface texture of the sonotrode and initial mating surfaces, and (6) presence of oxide-scale at the mating surfaces, which further contribute significantly specifically to the grain substructure evolution at the interface and to the anisotropic bulk deformation away from the interface during UC in general. The model results have been predicted for Al-3003 alloy undergoing UC. A good agreement between the experimental and simulated results has been observed for the evolution of linear weld density and anisotropic global strengths macroscopically. Similarly, microscopic observations such as embrittlement due to grain substructure evolution at the UC interface have been also demonstrated by the simulation. In conclusion, the model was able to predict the effects of macroscopic global boundary conditions on bond quality. It has been found that the normal pressure enhances good bonding characteristics at the interface, though beyond a certain magnitude enhances dynamic failure. Similarly, lower oscillation amplitudes result in a lower rate of gap closure, whereas higher oscillation amplitude results in an enhanced rate of gap relaxation at the interface. Henceforth, good bonding characteristics between the constituent foils are found at an optimum oscillation amplitude. A similar analogy is also true for weld speed where the longitudinal locations behind the sonotrode rip open when higher weld speeds are implemented in the UC machine, leading to lower linear weld density and poor bonding characteristics.},

abstract = {In this review we present a thoroughly comprehensive survey of recent work on modified theories of gravity and their cosmological consequences. Amongst other things, we cover General Relativity, scalar-tensor, Einstein-{\ae}ther, and Bimetric theories, as well as TeVeS, . f(R), general higher-order theories, Hořava-Lifschitz gravity, Galileons, Ghost Condensates, and models of extra dimensions including Kaluza-Klein, Randall-Sundrum, DGP, and higher co-dimension braneworlds. We also review attempts to construct a Parameterised Post-Friedmannian formalism, that can be used to constrain deviations from General Relativity in cosmology, and that is suitable for comparison with data on the largest scales. These subjects have been intensively studied over the past decade, largely motivated by rapid progress in the field of observational cosmology that now allows, for the first time, precision tests of fundamental physics on the scale of the observable Universe. The purpose of this review is to provide a reference tool for researchers and students in cosmology and gravitational physics, as well as a self-contained, comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to the subject as a whole. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper the relaxed micromorphic continuum model with weighted free and gradient micro-inertia is used to describe the dynamical behavior of a real two-dimensional phononic crystal for a wide range of wavelengths. In particular, a periodic structure with specific micro-structural topology and mechanical properties, capable of opening a phononic band-gap, is chosen with the criterion of showing a low degree of anisotropy (the band-gap is almost independent of the direction of propagation of the traveling wave). A Bloch wave analysis is performed to obtain the dispersion curves and the corresponding vibrational modes of the periodic structure. A linear-elastic, isotropic, relaxed micromorphic model including both a free micro-inertia (related to free vibrations of the microstructures) and a gradient micro-inertia (related to the motions of the microstructure which are coupled to the macro-deformation of the unit cell) is introduced and particularized to the case of plane wave propagation. The parameters of the relaxed model, which are independent of frequency, are then calibrated on the dispersion curves of the phononic crystal showing an excellent agreement in terms of both dispersion curves and vibrational modes. Almost all the homogenized elastic parameters of the relaxed micromorphic model result to be determined. This opens the way to the design of morphologically complex meta-structures which make use of the chosen phononic structure as the basic building block and which preserve its ability of "stopping" elastic wave propagation at the scale of the structure.},

It is shown that the inertia of energy does not obviate the necessity for assuming the conservation of matter. Matter is to be interpreted as number of molecules, therefore, and not as inertia. Its velocity vector serves to define local proper-time axes, and the energy momentum tensor is resolved into proper-time and -space components. It is shown that the first law of thermodynamics is a scalar equation, and not the fourth component of the energy-momentum principle. Temperature and entropy also prove to be scalars. Simple relativistic generalizations of Fourier's law of heat conduction, and of the laws of viscosity are obtained from the requirements of the second law. The same considerations lead directly to the accepted relativistic form of Ohm's law.},

abstract = {Extended Theories of Gravity can be considered as a new paradigm to cure shortcomings of General Relativity at infrared and ultraviolet scales. They are an approach that, by preserving the undoubtedly positive results of Einstein's theory, is aimed to address conceptual and experimental problems recently emerged in astrophysics, cosmology and High Energy Physics. In particular, the goal is to encompass, in a self-consistent scheme, problems like inflation, dark energy, dark matter, large scale structure and, first of all, to give at least an effective description of Quantum Gravity. We review the basic principles that any gravitational theory has to follow. The geometrical interpretation is discussed in a broad perspective in order to highlight the basic assumptions of General Relativity and its possible extensions in the general framework of gauge theories. Principles of such modifications are presented, focusing on specific classes of theories like f(R)-gravity and scalar-tensor gravity in the metric and Palatini approaches. The special role of torsion is also discussed. The conceptual features of these theories are fully explored and attention is paid to the issues of dynamical and conformal equivalence between them considering also the initial value problem. A number of viability criteria are presented considering the post-Newtonian and the post-Minkowskian limits. In particular, we discuss the problems of neutrino oscillations and gravitational waves in extended gravity. Finally, future perspectives of extended gravity are considered with possibility to go beyond a trial and error approach. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We further extend the model of bulk viscosity to include a Cosmological Constant. We contrast the previous results with the cosmology of universes with non-zero shear viscosity.

abstract = {We present the results of a study confronting density maps reconstructed by the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator (DTFE) and by regular SPH kernel-based techniques. The comparison between the two methods clearly demonstrates the superior performance of the DTFE with respect to conventional SPH methods, in particular at locations where SPH appears to fail. The DTFE is a fully self-adaptive technique for reconstructing continuous density fields from discrete particle distributions, and is based upon the corresponding Delaunay tessellation. Its principal asset is its complete independence of arbitrary smoothing functions and parameters specifying the properties of these. As a result it manages to faithfully reproduce the anisotropies of the local particle distribution and through its adaptive and local nature proves to be optimally suited for uncovering the full structural richness in the density distribution. Through the improvement in local density estimates, calculations invoking the DTFE will yield a much better representation of physical processes which depend on density. The presented results form an encouraging step towards the application and insertion of the DTFE in astrophysical hydrocodes. We describe an outline for the construction of a particle hydrodynamics code in which the DTFE replaces kernel-based methods. Further discussion addresses the issue and possibilities for a moving grid based hydrocode invoking the DTFE, and Delaunay tessellations, in an attempt to combine the virtues of the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches.},

abstract = {We propose a low Mach number, Godunov-type finite volume scheme for the numerical solution of the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics. The scheme combines Klein's non-stiff/stiff decomposition of the fluxes [J. Comput. Phys., 121 (1995), pp. 213--237] with an explicit/implicit time discretization [F. Cordier, P. Degond, and A. Kumbaro, J. Comput. Phys., 231 (2012), pp. 5685--5704] for the split fluxes. This results in a scalar second order partial differential equation (PDE) for the pressure, which we solve by an iterative approximation. Due to our choice of a crucial reference pressure, the stiff subsystem is hyperbolic, and the second order PDE for the pressure is elliptic. The scheme is also uniformly asymptotically consistent. Numerical experiments show that the scheme needs to be stabilized for low Mach numbers. Unfortunately, this affects the asymptotic consistency, which becomes nonuniform in the Mach number, and requires an unduly fine grid in the small Mach number limit. On the other han...},

A set of formal and semantic postulates are elaborated from where the physical meaning of various key concepts of the theory are clarified.

It is shown that Teleparallel Gravity admits a wider representation of space-time than General Relativity, allowing to define properties of the gravitational field such as energy and momentum that are usually considered problematic. In this sense, although the dynamical equations of both theories are equivalent, their inequivalence from a physical point of view is demonstrated. Finally, the axiomatic formulation is used to compare Teleparallel Gravity with other theories of gravity based on absolute parallelism such as non-local and f(T) gravity.},

@article{Tino2020,
abstract = {General Relativity is today the best theory of gravity addressing a wide range of phenomena. Our understanding of physical laws, from cosmology to local scales, cannot be properly formulated without taking into account its concepts, procedures and formalim. It is based on one of the most fundamental principles of Nature, the Equivalence Principle, which represents the core of the Einstein theory of gravity describing, under the same standard, the metric and geodesic structure of the spacetime. The confirmation of its validity at different scales and in different contexts represents one of the main challenges of modern physics both from the theoretical and the experimental points of view. A major issue related to this principle is the fact that we actually do not know if it is valid or not at quantum level. We are simply assuming its validity at fundamental scales. This question is crucial in any self-consistent theory of gravity. Furthermore, recent progress on relativistic theories of gravity, including deviations from General Relativity at various scales, such as extensions and alternatives to the Einstein theory, have to take into account, besides the Equivalence Principle, new issues like Dark Matter and Dark Energy, as well as the validity of fundamental principles like local Lorentz and position invari-ance. The general trend is that high precision experiments are conceived and realized to test both Einstein's theory and its alternatives at fundamental level using established and novel methods. For example, experiments based on quantum sensors (atomic clocks, accelerometers, gyroscopes, 1 gravimeters, etc.) allow to set stringent constraints on well established symmetry laws (e.g. CPT and Lorentz invariance), on the physics beyond the Standard Model of particles and interactions, and on General Relativity and its possible extensions. In this review, we discuss precision tests of gravity in General Relativity and alternative theories and their relation with the Equivalence Principle. In the first part, we discuss the Einstein Equivalence Principle according to its weak and strong formulation. We recall some basic topics of General Relativity and the necessity of its extension. Some models of modified gravity are presented in some details. This provides us the ground for discussing the Equivalence Principle also in the framework of extended and alternative theories of gravity. In particular, we focus on the possibility to violate the Equivalence Principle at finite temperature, both in the frameworks of General Relativity and of modified gravity. Equivalence Principle violations in the Standard Model Extension are also discussed. The second part of the paper is devoted to the experimental tests of the Equivalence Principle in its weak formulation. We present the results and methods used in high-precision experiments, and discuss the potential and prospects for future experimental tests. 2},

abstract = {A complete continuum thermoelastic theory for large deformation of crystals of arbitrary symmetry is developed. The theory incorporates as a fundamental state variable in the thermodynamic potentials what is termed an Eulerian strain tensor (in material coordinates) constructed from the inverse of the deformation gradient. Thermodynamic identities and relationships among Eulerian and the usual Lagrangian material coefficients are derived, significantly extending previous literature that focused on materials with cubic or hexagonal symmetry and hydrostatic loading conditions. Analytical solutions for homogeneous deformations of ideal cubic crystals are studied over a prescribed range of elastic coefficients; stress states and intrinsic stability measures are compared. For realistic coefficients, Eulerian theory is shown to predict more physically realistic behavior than Lagrangian theory under large compression and shear. Analytical solutions for shock compression of anisotropic single crystals are derived for internal energy functions quartic in Lagrangian or Eulerian strain and linear in entropy; results are analyzed for quartz, sapphire, and diamond. When elastic constants of up to order four are included, both Lagrangian and Eulerian theories are capable of matching Hugoniot data. When only the second-order elastic constant is known, an alternative theory incorporating a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian strain tensor provides a reasonable approximation of experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In both cases, the Beverloo scaling is recovered. We first do not attempt a quantitative comparison, but focus on the qualitative behavior of velocity and pressure at different locations in the flow. A good agreement for the velocity is obtained in the regions of rapid flows, while areas of slow creep are not entirely captured by the continuum model. The pressure field shows a general good agreement, while bulk deformations are found to be similar in both approaches. The influence of the parameters of the $\mu$(I) flow law is systematically investigated, showing the importance of the dependence on the inertial number I to achieve quantitative agreement between continuum and discrete discharge. However, potential problems involving the systems size, the configuration and "non-local" effects, are suggested. Yet the general ability of the continuum model to reproduce qualitatively the granular behavior is found to be very encouraging.},

abstract = {The regularized 13-moment equations (R13) are a successful macro- scopic model to describe non-equilibrium gas flows in rarefied or micro situ- ations. Even though the equations have been derived for the nonlinear case and many examples demonstrate the usefulness of the equations, sofar, the important property of an accompanying entropy law could only be shown for the linearized equations [Struchtrup{\&}Torrilhon, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, (2007), 014502]. Based on an approach suggested by Ottinger ̈ [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, (2010), 120601], this paper presents a nonlinear entropy law for the R13 sys- tem. In the derivation the variables and equations of the R13 system are nonlinearily extended such that an entropy law with non-negative production can be formulated. It is then demonstrated that the original R13 system is included in the new equations.},

@article{Beghini2021,
abstract = {Simulation of additive manufacturing processes can provide essential insight into material behavior, residual stress, and ultimately, the performance of additively manufactured parts. In this work, we describe a new simulation based workflow utilizing both solid mechanics and fluid mechanics based formulations within the finite element software package SIERRA (Sierra Solid Mechanics Team in Sierra/SolidMechanics 4.52 User's Guide SAND2019-2715. Technical report, Sandia National Laboratories, 2011) to enable integrated simulations of directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing processes. In this methodology, a high-fidelity fluid mechanics based model of additive manufacturing is employed as the first step in a simulation workflow. This fluid model uses a level set field to track the location of the boundary between the solid material and background gas and precisely predicts temperatures and material deposition shapes from additive manufacturing process parameters. The resulting deposition shape and temperature field from the fluid model are then mapped into a solid mechanics formulation to provide a more accurate surface topology for radiation and convection boundary conditions and a prescribed temperature field. Solid mechanics simulations are then conducted to predict the evolution of material stresses and microstructure within a part. By combining thermal history and deposition shape from fluid mechanics with residual stress and material property evolutions from solid mechanics, additional fidelity and precision are incorporated into additive manufacturing process simulations providing new insight into complex DED builds.},

@article{Dongari2013,
abstract = {We investigate a power-law probability distribution function to describe the mean free path of rarefied gas molecules in non-planar geometries. A new curvature-dependent model is derived by taking into account the boundary-limiting effects on the molecular mean free path for surfaces with both convex and concave curvatures. The Navier-Stokes constitutive relations and the velocity-slip boundary conditions are then modified based on this power-law scaling through the transport property expressions in terms of the mean free path. Velocity profiles for isothermal cylindrical Couette flow are obtained using this power-law model and compared with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) data. We demonstrate that our model is more accurate than the classical slip solution, and we are able to capture important non-linear trends associated with the non-equilibrium physics of the Knudsen layer. In addition, we establish a new criterion for the critical accommodation coefficient that leads to the non-intuitive phenomenon of velocity inversion. The power-law model predicts that the critical accommodation coefficient is significantly lower than that calculated using the classical slip solution, and is in good agreement with available DSMC data. Our proposed constitutive scaling for non-planar surfaces is based on simple physical arguments and can be readily implemented in conventional fluid dynamics codes for arbitrary geometric configurations of microfluidic systems.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Viscoplasticity is characterized by a yield stress, below which the materials will not deform, and above which they will deform and flow according to different constitutive relations. Viscoplastic models include the Bingham plastic, the Herschel- Bulkley model, and the Casson model. All of these ideal models are discontinuous. Analytical solutions exist for such models in simple flows. For general flow fields, it is necessary to develop numerical techniques to track down yielded/unyielded regions. This can be avoided by introducing into the models a continuation parameter, which facilitates the solution process and produces virtually the same results as the ideal models by the right choice of its value. This work reviews several benchmark problems of viscoplastic flows, such as entry and exit flows from dies, flows around a sphere and a cylinder, and squeeze flows. Examples are also given for typical processing flows of viscoplastic materials, where the extent and shape of the yielded/unyielded regions are clearly shown. KEYWORDS:},

abstract = {A modified Einstein equation of general relativity is obtained by using the principle of least action, a decomposition of symmetric tensors on a time oriented Lorentzian manifold, and a fundamental postulate of general relativity. The decomposition introduces a new symmetric tensor $\Phi$ $\alpha$$\beta$ which describes the energy-momentum of the gravitational field itself. It completes Einstein's equation and addresses the energy localization problem. The positive part of , the trace of the new tensor with respect to the metric, describes dark energy. The cosmological constant must vanish and is dynamically replaced by. A cyclic universe which developed after the Big Bang is described. The dark energy density provides a natural explanation of why the vacuum energy density is so small, and why it dominates the present epoch of the universe. The negative part of describes the attractive self-gravitating energy of the gravitational field. $\Phi$ $\alpha$$\beta$ introduces two additional terms into the Newtonian radial force equation: the force due to dark energy and the 1 r "dark matter" force. When the dark energy force balances the Newtonian force, the flat rotation curves and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation are obtained. The Newtonian rotation curves for galaxies with no flat orbital curves and those with rising rotation curves for large radii are described as examples of the flexibility of the orbital rotation curve equation.},

We demonstrate how this approach leads to a relativistic version of the Cattaneo equation, encoding the finite thermal relaxation time that is required to satisfy causality. We also show that the model naturally includes the non-equilibrium Gibbs relation that is a key ingredient in most approaches to extended thermodynamics. Focussing on the pure heat conduction problem, we compare the variational results to the second-order model developed by Israel and Stewart. The comparison shows that, despite the very different philosophies behind the two approaches, the two models are equivalent at first order deviations from thermal equilibrium. Finally, we complete the picture by working out the non-relativistic limit of our results, making contact with recent work in that regime.},

For a straight screw dislocation, we find the stress field which is modified near the dislocation core due to the appearance of moment stress. For the first time, we calculate the localized moment stress, the Nye tensor, the elastoplastic energy and the modified Peach-Koehler force of a screw dislocation in this framework. Moreover, we discuss the straightforward analogy between a screw dislocation and a magnetic vortex.

abstract = {A compressible ideal fluid is governed by Euler's equation of motion and equations of continuity, entropy and vorticity. This system can be reformulated in a form analogous to that of electromagnetism governed by Maxwell's equations with source terms. The vorticity plays the role of magnetic field, while the velocity field plays the part of a vector potential and the enthalpy (of isentropic flows) plays the part of a scalar potential in electromagnetism. The evolution of source terms of fluid Maxwell equations is determined by solving the equations of motion and continuity. The equation of sound waves can be derived from this formulation, where time evolution of the sound source is determined by the equation of motion. The theory of vortex sound of aeroacoustics is included in this formulation. It is remarkable that the forces acting on a point mass moving in a velocity field of an inviscid fluid are analogous in their form to the electric force and Lorentz force in electromagnetism. The significance of the reformulation is interpreted by examples taken from fluid mechanics. This formulation can be extended to viscous fluids without difficulty. The Maxwell-type equations are unchanged by the viscosity effect, although the source terms have additional terms due to viscosities.},

abstract = {Understanding thermal transport from nanoscale heat sources is important for a fundamental description of energy flow in materials, as well as for many technological applications including thermal management in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics, thermoelectric devices, nanoenhanced photovoltaics, and nanoparticle-mediated thermal therapies. Thermal transport at the nanoscale is fundamentally different from that at the macroscale and is determined by the distribution of carrier mean free paths and energy dispersion in a material, the length scales of the heat sources, and the distance over which heat is transported. Past work has shown that Fourier's law for heat conduction dramatically overpredicts the rate of heat dissipation from heat sources with dimensions smaller than the mean free path of the dominant heat-carrying phonons. In this work, we uncover a new regime of nanoscale thermal transport that dominates when the separation between nanoscale heat sources is small compared with the dominant phonon mean free paths. Surprisingly, the interaction of phonons originating from neighboring heat sources enables more efficient diffusive-like heat dissipation, even from nanoscale heat sources much smaller than the dominant phonon mean free paths. This finding suggests that thermal management in nanoscale systems including integrated circuits might not be as challenging as previously projected. Finally, we demonstrate a unique capability to extract differential conductivity as a function of phonon mean free path in materials, allowing the first (to our knowledge) experimental validation of predictions from the recently developed first-principles calculations.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we set up the theory of elastic matter sources within the framework of general relativity in a self-contained manner. The discussion is primarily based on the presentation of Carter and Quintana but also includes new methods and results as well as some modifications that in our opinion make the theory more modern and transparent. For instance, the equations of motion for the matter are shown to take a neat form when expressed in terms of the relativistic Hadamard elasticity tensor. Using this formulation we obtain simple formulae for the speeds of elastic wave propagation along eigendirections of the pressure tensor. Secondly, we apply the theory to static spherically symmetric configurations using a specific equation of state and consider models either having an elastic crust or core.},

We also assess the validity of underlying assumptions in wall-model derivations to elucidate the accuracy of these investigations, and offer suggestions for future studies.},

abstract = {We study the plane shear flow of a dense assembly of dissipative disks using discrete simulation and prescribing the pressure and the shear rate. Those shear states are steady and uniform, and become intermittent in the quasistatic regime. In the limit of rigid grains, the shear state is determined by a single dimensionless number, called the inertial number I , which describes the ratio of inertial to pressure forces. Small values of I correspond to the quasistatic critical state of soil mechanics, while large values of I correspond to the fully collisional regime of kinetic theory. When I increases in the intermediate dense flow regime, we measure an approximately linear decrease of the solid fraction from the maximum packing value, and an approximately linear increase of the effective friction coefficient from the static internal friction value. From those dilatancy and friction laws, we deduce the constitutive law for dense granular flows, with a plastic Coulomb term and a viscous Bagnold term. The mechanical characteristics of the grains (restitution, friction, and elasticity) have a small influence in the dense flow regime. Finally, we show that the evolution of the relative velocity fluctuations and of the contact force anisotropy as a function of I provides a simple explanation of the friction law.},

Several research projects in the late 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century indicated that the addition of very small amounts of nanoparticles in common cooling fluids increases significantly the effective thermal conductivity of the suspensions and their convective heat and mass transfer coefficients. While typical experimentally determined conductivity enhancements were in the range of 10-50{\%}, some early experiments exhibited enhancements higher than 100{\%}. Experiments on the mass transfer coefficients and the viscosity of these solid-liquid suspensions reported more dramatic results with maximum mass transfer enhancements in the range of two to six times that of the base fluid. Such experimental observations indicate that appropriately designed engineering systems operating with suitable nanofluids will have heat and mass transfer characteristics that are superior to currently used fluids.},

abstract = {Imagine a freely rotating rigid body. The body has three principal axes of rotation. It follows from mathematical analysis of the evolution equations that pure rotations around the major and minor axes are stable while rotation around the middle axis is unstable. However, only rotation around the major axis (with highest moment of inertia) is stable in physical reality (as demonstrated by the unexpected change of rotation of the Explorer 1 probe). We propose a general method of Ehrenfest regularization of Hamiltonian equations by which the reversible Hamiltonian equations are equipped with irreversible terms constructed from the Hamiltonian dynamics itself. The method is demonstrated on harmonic oscillator, rigid body motion (solving the problem of stable minor axis rotation), ideal fluid mechanics and kinetic theory. In particular, the regularization can be seen as a birth of irreversibility and dissipation. In addition, we discuss and propose discretizations of the Ehrenfest regularized evolution equations such that key model characteristics (behavior of energy and entropy) are valid in the numerical scheme as well.},

Molecular simulations of a heated cavity with varying parameters show intricate flow patterns for weak, or inverted transpiration force. Microscopic and macroscopic transport equations for rarefied gases are solved to study the flow patterns and identify the main driving forces for the flow. It turns out that the patterns arise from a competition between thermal transpiration force at the boundary and thermal stresses in the bulk.},

In this contribution, we present direct time-resolved imaging of melt pool flow dynamics from a high-energy synchrotron radiation experiment. We track internal flow streams during arc welding of steel and measure instantaneous flow velocities ranging from 0.1 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} to 0.5 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. When the temperature-dependent surface tension coefficient is negative, bulk turbulence is the main flow mechanism and the critical velocity for surface turbulence is below the limits identified in previous theoretical studies. When the alloy exhibits a positive temperature-dependent surface tension coefficient, surface turbulence occurs and derisory oxides can be entrapped within the subsequent solid as result of higher flow velocities. The widely used arc welding and the emerging arc additive manufacturing routes can be optimised by controlling internal melt flow through adjusting surface active elements.},

@article{Barker2017a,
abstract = {In recent years considerable progress has been made in the continuum modelling of granular flows, in particular the {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D707{\}}(I){\$} -rheology, which links the local viscosity in a flow to the strain rate and pressure through the non-dimensional inertial number {\$}I{\$} . This formulation greatly benefits from its similarity to the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations as it allows many existing numerical methods to be used. Unfortunately, this system of equations is ill posed when the inertial number is too high or too low. The consequence of ill posedness is that the growth rate of small perturbations tends to infinity in the high wavenumber limit. Due to this, numerical solutions are grid dependent and cannot be taken as being physically realistic. In this paper changes to the functional form of the {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D707{\}}(I){\$} curve are considered, in order to maximise the range of well-posed inertial numbers, while preserving the overall structure of the equations. It is found that when the inertial number is low there exist curves for which the equations are guaranteed to be well posed. However when the inertial number is very large the equations are found to be ill posed regardless of the functional dependence of {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D707{\}}{\$} on {\$}I{\$} . A new {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D707{\}}(I){\$} curve, which is inspired by the analysis of the governing equations and by experimental data, is proposed here. In order to test this regularised rheology, transient granular flows on inclined planes are studied. It is found that simulations of flows, which show signs of ill posedness with unregularised models, are numerically stable and match key experimental observations when the regularised model is used. This paper details two-dimensional transient computations of decelerating flows where the inertial number tends to zero, high-speed flows that have large inertial numbers, and flows which develop into granular rollwaves. This is the first time that granular rollwaves have been simulated in two dimensions, which represents a major step towards the simulation of other complex granular flows.},

abstract = {Minimizing the residual stress build-up in metal-based additive manufacturing plays a pivotal role in selecting a particular material and technique for making an industrial part. In beam-based additive manufacturing, although a great deal of effort has been made to minimize the residual stresses, it is still elusive how to do so by simply optimizing the manufacturing parameters, such as beam size, beam power, and scan speed. With reference to the Ti6Al4V alloy and manufacturing by electron beam melting, we perform systematic finite element modeling of one-pass scanning to study the effects of beam size, beam power density, beam scan speed, and chamber bed temperature on the magnitude and distribution of residual stresses. Our study elucidates both qualitative and quantitative features of the residual stress fields originated by these manufacturing parameters. Our findings can serve as useful guidelines for engineers and designers to deal with residual stress build-up during additive manufacturing of Ti6Al4V.},

abstract = {The solid-liquid phase change problems were solved by the lattice Boltzmann method in this paper. By modifying the equilibrium distribution function for the temperature, a new approach was developed to treat the latent-heat source term. As compared with the previous work, the approach developed in this paper could avoid iteration steps or solving a group of linear equations, which guaranteed this approach's high efficiency. The phase interface was traced by updating the total enthalpy, and the moving interface was treated by the immersed moving boundary scheme proposed by Noble and Torczynski for simulation of particulate suspensions. The approach was firstly validated by the problem of conduction-induced melting in a semi-infinite space, and good agreement with the analytical result was obtained. Then it was used to simulate melting problems coupled with natural convection, which demonstrated that the approach could produce consistent results as compared with other numerical method. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The gas flow is considered as fully established so that the dependence of all quantities on time is harmonical. The problem is solved for several values of two main parameters determining its solution, namely, the gas rarefaction defined as the ratio of the distance between the plates to the equivalent free path of gaseous molecules, and the oscillation parameter given as the ratio of the intermolecular collision frequency to the wave frequency. The reciprocal relation for such flows is obtained and verified numerically. An influence of the gas-surface accommodation coefficients on the wave characteristics is analyzed by employing the Cercignani-Lampis scattering kernel to the boundary conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In general relativity (GR), the metric tensor of spacetime is essential since it represents the gravitational potential. In other gauge theories (such as electromagnetism), the so-called premetric approach succeeds in separating the purely topological field equation from the metric-dependent constitutive law. We show here that GR allows for a premetric formulation, too. For this purpose, we apply the teleparallel approach of gravity, which represents GR as a gauge theory based on the translation group. We formulate the metric-free topological field equation and a general linear constitutive law between the basic field variables. The requirement of local Lorentz invariance turns the model into a full equivalent of GR. Our approach opens a way for a natural extension of GR to diverse geometrical structures of spacetime.},

abstract = {We consider an infinite 3-dimensional elastic continuum whose material points experience no displacements, only rotations. This framework is a special case of the Cosserat theory of elasticity. Rotations of material points are described mathematically by attaching to each geometric point an orthonormal basis which gives a field of orthonormal bases called the coframe. As the dynamical variables (unknowns) of our theory we choose the coframe and a density. We write down the general dynamic variational functional for our rotational theory of elasticity, assuming our material to be physically linear but the kinematic model geometrically nonlinear. Allowing geometric nonlinearity is natural when dealing with rotations because rotations in dimension 3 are inherently nonlinear (rotations about different axes do not commute) and because there is no reason to exclude from our study large rotations such as full turns. The main result of the paper is an explicit construction of a class of time-dependent solutions which we call plane wave solutions; these are travelling waves of rotations. The existence of such explicit closed form solutions is a nontrivial fact given that our system of Euler-Lagrange equations is highly nonlinear. In the last section we consider a special case of our rotational theory of elasticity which in the stationary setting (harmonic time dependence and arbitrary dependence on spatial coordinates) turns out to be equivalent to a pair of massless Dirac equations.},

A set of governing equations describing the time evolution of concentration, flux, internal structure (of the complex polymeric membrane) and area tensor is obtained. Four parameters appear in the governing equations. Two parameters characterize the importance of elasticity and mixing and the remaining two parameters account for the effects of the complex interface. An extension of Fick's second law, which includes the convective fluxes due to the change of polymer internal structure and complex interface, is derived for the flux evolution.

In this study, a multi-physics model is developed to simulate evolution of alloy microstructure during solidification, which incorporates heat transfer, fluid dynamics, kinetics of phase transformations, and grain growth. In this integrated simulation framework, the phase field method for the dendritic growth of a dilute binary alloy is coupled with the thermal lattice Boltzmann method for the melt flow and heat transfer. The effects of latent heat, melt flow and cooling rate on solidification process are also investigated. The multi-physics simulation results provide new insight to predict the complex solidification process more accurately than single-physics approaches.},

abstract = {The aim of this article is to discuss the concepts of non-local rheology and fluidity, recently introduced to describe dense granular flows. We review and compare various approaches based on different constitutive relations and choices for the fluidity parameter, focusing on the kinetic elasto-plastic model introduced by Bocquet et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett 103, 036001 (2009)] for soft matter, and adapted for granular matter by Kamrin et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 178301 (2012)], and the gradient expansion of the local rheology {\$}\backslashmu(I){\$} that we have proposed [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 238301 (2013)]. We emphasise that, to discriminate between these approaches, one has to go beyond the predictions derived from linearisation around a uniform stress profile, such as that obtained in a simple shear cell. We argue that future tests can be based on the nature of the chosen fluidity parameter, and the related boundary conditions, as well as the hypothesis made to derive the models and the dynamical mechanisms underlying their dynamics.},

abstract = {The extreme temperatures and energy densities generated by ultra-relativistic collisions between heavy nuclei produce a state of matter with surprising fluid properties. Non-central collisions have angular momentum on the order of 1000{\$}\backslashhbar{\$}, and the resulting fluid may have a strong vortical structure that must be understood to properly describe the fluid. It is also of particular interest because the restoration of fundamental symmetries of quantum chromodynamics is expected to produce novel physical effects in the presence of strong vorticity. However, no experimental indications of fluid vorticity in heavy ion collisions have so far been found. Here we present the first measurement of an alignment between the angular momentum of a non-central collision and the spin of emitted particles, revealing that the fluid produced in heavy ion collisions is by far the most vortical system ever observed. We find that {\$}\backslashLambda{\$} and {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}\backslashLambda{\}}{\$} hyperons show a positive polarization of the order of a few percent, consistent with some hydrodynamic predictions. A previous measurement that reported a null result at higher collision energies is seen to be consistent with the trend of our new observations, though with larger statistical uncertainties. These data provide the first experimental access to the vortical structure of the "perfect fluid" created in a heavy ion collision. They should prove valuable in the development of hydrodynamic models that quantitatively connect observations to the theory of the Strong Force. Our results extend the recent discovery of hydrodynamic spin alignment to the subatomic realm.},

abstract = {General Relativity and the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM framework are currently the standard lore and constitute the concordance paradigm. Nevertheless, long-standing open theoretical issues, as well as possible new observational ones arising from the explosive development of cosmology the last two decades, offer the motivation and lead a large amount of research to be devoted in constructing various extensions and modifications. All extended theories and scenarios are first examined under the light of theoretical consistency, and then are applied to various geometrical backgrounds, such as the cosmological and the spherical symmetric ones. Their predictions at both the background and perturbation levels, and concerning cosmology at early, intermediate and late times, are then confronted with the huge amount of observational data that astrophysics and cosmology are able to offer recently. Theories, scenarios and models that successfully and efficiently pass the above steps are classified as viable and are candidates for the description of Nature. We list the recent developments in the fields of gravity and cosmology, presenting the state of the art, high-lighting the open problems, and outlining the directions of future research. Its realization is performed in the framework of the COST European Action "Cosmology and Astrophysics Network for Theoretical Advances and Training Actions".},

abstract = {A continuum description of granular flows would be of considerable help in predicting natural geophysical hazards or in designing industrial processes. However, the constitutive equations for dry granular flows, which govern how the material moves under shear, are still a matter of debate. One difficulty is that grains can behave like a solid (in a sand pile), a liquid (when poured from a silo) or a gas (when strongly agitated). For the two extreme regimes, constitutive equations have been proposed based on kinetic theory for collisional rapid flows, and soil mechanics for slow plastic flows. However, the intermediate dense regime, where the granular material flows like a liquid, still lacks a unified view and has motivated many studies over the past decade. The main characteristics of granular liquids are: a yield criterion (a critical shear stress below which flow is not possible) and a complex dependence on shear rate when flowing. In this sense, granular matter shares similarities with classical visco-plastic fluids such as Bingham fluids. Here we propose a new constitutive relation for dense granular flows, inspired by this analogy and recent numerical and experimental work. We then test our three-dimensional (3D) model through experiments on granular flows on a pile between rough sidewalls, in which a complex 3D flow pattern develops. We show that, without any fitting parameter, the model gives quantitative predictions for the flow shape and velocity profiles. Our results support the idea that a simple visco-plastic approach can quantitatively capture granular flow properties, and could serve as a basic tool for modelling more complex flows in geophysical or industrial applications. 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

@article{Clifton1981,
abstract = {Precursor decay in plate impact experiments on single crystals is re-examined from the viewpoint of the elastodynamics of moving dislocations. Superposition of solutions for many dislocations set in motion by an incident plane wave is used to relate the decay of the wave amplitude at the front of the plane wave to the density and velocity of dislocations at the wavefront. The resulting precursor decay relation is the same as the one derived from an elastic/visco-plastic model of the material, except for a small correction due to differences between the effects of forward and backward propagating dislocations. Motivated by this added support for the validity of the precursor decay equation, the values used for the quantities in this equation are re-examined. Recent experimental results and the elastodynamics analysis are interpreted as indicating that the commonly-used values of dislocation velocity are probably satisfactory, but that the values used for dislocation density are several orders of magnitude too small near the lapped surfaces of the crystal. These large dislocation densities are identified as the probable dominant cause of the lower-than-predicted precursor amplitudes that are recorded in experiments. More accurate experimental data and inclusion of the non-linear elasticity effects are essential in determining whether or not the observed precursor decay in the bulk of the specimen can be explained by the motion of dislocations present initially. Calculations of energy radiated from screw and edge dislocations that start from rest and move thereafter at constant velocity confirm that dislocation drag forces due to continuum elasticity effects are small for dislocation velocities less than, say, 80{\%} of the elastic shear wave speed. At supersonic speeds the continuum drag effects become so large that sustained supersonic motion of dislocations appears unlikely. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) is a powder-bed additive manufacturing process that uses laser to melt powders, layer by layer to generate a functional 3D part. There are many different parameters, such as laser power, scanning speed, and layer thickness, which play a role in determining the quality of the printed part. These parameters contribute to the energy density applied on the powder bed. Defects arise when insufficient or excess energy density is applied. A common defect in these cases is the presence of porosity. This paper studies the formation of porosities when inappropriate energy densities are used. A computational model was developed to simulate the melting and solidification process of SS316L powders in the SLM process. Three different sets of process parameters were used to produce 800-lm-long melt tracks, and the characteristics of the porosities were analyzed. It was found that when low energy density parameters were used, the pores were found to be irregular in shapes and were located near the top surface of the powder bed. However, when high energy density parameters were used, the pores were either elliptical or spherical in shapes and were usually located near the bottom of the keyholes.},

abstract = {In microrheology, the local and bulk mechanical properties of a complex fluid are extracted from the motion of probe particles embedded within it. In passive microrheology, particles are forced by thermal fluctuations and probe linear viscoelasticity, whereas active microrheology involves forcing probes externally and can be extended out of equilibrium to the nonlinear regime. Here we review the development, present state, and future directions of this field. We organize our review around the generalized Stokes-Einstein relation (GSER), which plays a central role in the interpretation of microrheology. By discussing the Stokes and Einstein components of the GSER individually, we identify the key assumptions that underpin each, and the consequences that occur when they are violated. We conclude with a discussion of two techniques—multiple particle-tracking and nonlinear microrheology—that have arisen to handle systems in which the GSER breaks down.},

abstract = {There are many different formulations of relativistic elasticity. Most of them are only concerned with formal questions rather than questions regarding the PDE point of view. The aim of this thesis is to obtain various local existence results for dynamical scenarios involving elastic matter. Following Beig and Schmidt we treat relativistic elasticity as a Lagrangian field theory. The basic unknowns are mappings between spacetime and an abstract material manifold. The equations of motion will be the Euler-Lagrange equations arising from the action principle. Under certain (physically reasonable) restrictions on the elastic properties of the material the resulting system is hyperbolic and local existence results can be derived. This way we can show well-posedness for the equations describing elastic matter on a fixed gravitational background, self-gravitating elastic matter and a finite elastic body on a fixed background. The thesis also contains some results on energy conservation and on linearized elasticity.},

The ionogel exhibits desired attributes of adequate conductivity (0.22 S m(-1)), low elastic modulus (∼3 kPa), large rupturing stretch (∼4.6), and negligible hysteresis and degradation after cyclic stretches of large amplitude. Using the ionogel and a dielectric elastomer, we fabricate electromechanical transducers that achieve a voltage-induced areal strain of 140{\%}. The ionogel is somewhat hygroscopic, but the transducers remain stable after a million cycles of excitation in a dry oven and in air. The transparency of the ionogels enable the transducers with conductors placed in the path of light, and the nonvolatility of the ionogels enable the transducers to be used in open air.},

abstract = {We present predictions of transport through micro-CT images of porous media that include the analysis of correlation structure, velocity, and the dynamics of the evolving plume. We simulate solute transport through millimeter-sized three-dimensional images of a beadpack, a sandstone, and a carbonate, representing porous media with an increasing degree of pore-scale complexity. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved to compute the flow field and a streamline simulation approach is used to move particles by advection, while the random walk method is employed to represent diffusion. We show how the computed propagators (concentration as a function of displacement) for the beadpack, sandstone, and carbonate depend on the width of the velocity distribution. A narrow velocity distribution in the beadpack leads to the least anomalous behavior, where the propagators rapidly become Gaussian in shape; the wider velocity distribution in the sandstone gives rise to a small immobile concentration peak, and a large secondary mobile peak moving at approximately the average flow speed; in the carbonate with the widest velocity distribution, the stagnant concentration peak is persistent, with a slower emergence of a smaller secondary mobile peak, characteristic of highly anomalous behavior. This defines different types of transport in the three media and quantifies the effect of pore structure on transport. The propagators obtained by the model are in excellent agreement with those measured on similar cores in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments by Scheven, Verganelakis, Harris, Johns, and Gladden, Phys.

abstract = {In this paper we venture a new look at the linear isotropic indeterminate couple stress model in the general framework of second gradient elasticity and we propose a new alternative formulation which obeys Cauchy-Boltzmann's axiom of the symmetry of the force stress tensor. For this model we prove the existence of solutions for the equilibrium problem. Relations with other gradient elastic theories and the possibility to switch from a {\{}4th order{\}} (gradient elastic) problem to a 2nd order micromorphic model are also discussed with a view of obtaining symmetric force-stress tensors. It is shown that the indeterminate couple stress model can be written entirely with symmetric force-stress and symmetric couple-stress. The difference of the alternative models rests in specifying traction boundary conditions of either rotational type or strain type. If rotational type boundary conditions are used in the partial integration, the classical anti-symmetric nonlocal force stress tensor formulation is obtained. Otherwise, the difference in both formulations is only a divergence--free second order stress field such that the field equations are the same, but the traction boundary conditions are different. For these results we employ a novel integrability condition, connecting the infinitesimal continuum rotation and the infinitesimal continuum strain. Moreover, we provide the complete, consistent traction boundary conditions for both models.},

abstract = {The continuum equations of fluid mechanics are rederived with the intention of keeping certain mechanical and thermodynamic concepts separate. A new "mechanical" mass density is created to be used in computing inertial quantities, whereas the actual mass density is treated as a thermodynamic variable. A new set of balance laws is proposed, including a mass balance equation with a non-convective flux. The basic principles of irreversible thermodynamics are used to obtain linear constitutive equations that are expansions of--not only the usual affinities involving gradients of temperature and velocity--but also the gradient of the chemical potential. Transport coefficients are then chosen based on an elementary diffusion model, which yields simple constitutive laws featuring just two transport parameters: one for the longitudinal part of the motion and one for the rotational part. The resulting formulation differs from the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations of fluid motion. In order to highlight key similarities and differences between the two approaches, several examples in fluid mechanics are treated in part II, including sound propagation, light scattering, steady-state shock waves, thermophoresis, and Poiseuille flow.},

abstract = {Abstract.: Two alternative routes are taken to derive, on the basis of the dynamics of a finite number of dumbbells, viscoelasticity in terms of a conformation tensor with fluctuations. The first route is a direct approach using stochastic calculus only, and it serves as a benchmark for the second route, which is guided by thermodynamic principles. In the latter, the Helmholtz free energy and a generalized relaxation tensor play a key role. It is shown that the results of the two routes agree only if a finite-size contribution to the Helmholtz free energy of the conformation tensor is taken into account. Using statistical mechanics, this finite-size contribution is derived explicitly in this paper for a large class of models; this contribution is non-zero whenever the number of dumbbells in the volume of observation is finite. It is noted that the generalized relaxation tensor for the conformation tensor does not need any finite-size correction. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

abstract = {We review the current state-of-the-art Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) schemes for the compressible Euler equations. We identify three prototypical schemes and apply them to a suite of test problems in one and two dimensions. The schemes are in order, standard SPH with an adaptive density kernel estimation (ADKE) technique introduced Sigalotti et al. (2008) [44], the variational SPH formulation of Price (2012) [33] (referred herein as the MPM scheme) and the Godunov type SPH (GSPH) scheme of Inutsuka (2002) [12]. The tests investigate the accuracy of the inviscid discretizations, shock capturing ability and the particle settling behavior. The schemes are found to produce nearly identical results for the 1D shock tube problems with the MPM and GSPH schemes being the most robust. The ADKE scheme requires parameter values which must be tuned to the problem at hand. We propose an addition of an artificial heating term to the GSPH scheme to eliminate unphysical spikes in the thermal energy at the contact discontinuity. The resulting modification is simple and can be readily incorporated in existing codes. In two dimensions, the differences between the schemes is more evident with the quality of results determined by the particle distribution. In particular, the ADKE scheme shows signs of particle clumping and irregular motion for the 2D strong shock and Sedov point explosion tests. The noise in particle data is linked with the particle distribution which remains regular for the Hamiltonian formulations (MPM and GSPH) and becomes irregular for the ADKE scheme. In the interest of reproducibility, we make available our implementation of the algorithms and test problems discussed in this work. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Gerya2015,
abstract = {Scientific theories of how subduction and plate tectonics began on Earth - and what the tectonic structure of Earth was before this - remain enigmatic and contentious. Understanding viable scenarios for the onset of subduction and plate tectonics is hampered by the fact that subduction initiation processes must have been markedly different before the onset of global plate tectonics because most present-day subduction initiation mechanisms require acting plate forces and existing zones of lithospheric weakness, which are both consequences of plate tectonics. However, plume-induced subduction initiation could have started the first subduction zone without the help of plate tectonics. Here, we test this mechanism using high-resolution three-dimensional numerical thermomechanical modelling. We demonstrate that three key physical factors combine to trigger self-sustained subduction: (1) a strong, negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere; (2) focused magmatic weakening and thinning of lithosphere above the plume; and (3) lubrication of the slab interface by hydrated crust. We also show that plume-induced subduction could only have been feasible in the hotter early Earth for old oceanic plates. In contrast, younger plates favoured episodic lithospheric drips rather than self-sustained subduction and global plate tectonics.},

The boost freedom in the choice of the tetrad is fixed by requiring that its timelike leg be orthogonal to the foliation, which consists of constant mean curvature slices. The rotational freedom in the tetrad is fixed by the 3D Nester gauge. With these conditions, the field equations reduce naturally to a first-order constrained symmetric hyperbolic evolution system which is coupled to elliptic equations for the gauge variables. The conformally rescaled equations are given explicitly, and their regularity at future null infinity is discussed. Our formulation is potentially useful for high accuracy numerical modeling of gravitational radiation emitted by inspiraling and merging black hole binaries and other highly relativistic isolated systems.},

We apply the algorithm to several numerical test problems such as sound wave propagation, shock tube and blast wave problems. In sound wave propagation, the intrinsic numerical viscosity is measured and its explicit expression is shown, which is the second-order of spatial resolution both in the presence and absence of physical viscosity. The expression of the numerical viscosity can be used to determine the maximum cell size in order to accurately measure the effect of physical viscosity in the numerical simulation.},

The critical Reynolds number indicating the cessation of the creeping Darcy flow regime in Estaillades carbonate is two orders of magnitude smaller than in Bentheimer sandstone, and is three orders of magnitude smaller than in the beadpack. It is inferred from the examination of flow field features that the emergence of steady eddies in pore space of Estaillades at elevated fluid velocities accounts for the early transition away from the Darcy flow regime. The non-Darcy coefficient $\beta$, the onset of non-Darcy flow, and the Darcy permeability for all samples are obtained and compared to available experimental data demonstrating the predictive capability of our approach. X-ray imaging along with direct pore-scale simulation of flow provides a viable alternative to experiments and empirical correlations for predicting non-Darcy flow parameters such as the $\beta$ factor, and the onset of non-Darcy flow.},

In particular, we show that for the class of mechanical systems subjected to nonintegrable constraints known as non-abelian nonholonomic Chaplygin systems, the constraint reaction force directly depends on this torsion. For these Chaplygin systems, we show how this torsional force can in some cases be removed by an appropriate choice of frame depending on a multiplier f (q), linking these results to the process of Chaplygin Hamiltonization through time reparameter-ization. Lastly, we show that the cyclic symmetries of f in some cases lead to the existence of momentum conservation laws for the original nonholonomic system and illustrate the results through several examples.

abstract = {In this paper we study the so called "warp drive" spacetimes within the {\$}U{\_}{\{}4{\}}{\$} Riemann-Cartan manifolds of Einstein-Cartan theory. Specifically, the role that spin may play with respect to energy condition violation is considered. It turns out that with the addition of spin, the torsion terms in Einstein-Cartan gravity do allow for energy condition respecting warp drives. Limits are derived which minimize the amount of spin required in order to have a weak/null-energy condition respecting system. This is done both for the traditional Alcubierre warp drive as well as for the modified warp drive of Van Den Broeck which minimizes the amount of matter required for the drive. The ship itself is in a region of effectively vacuum and hence the torsion, which in Einstein-Cartan theory is localized in matter, does not affect the geodesic nature of the ship's trajectory. We also comment on the amount of spin and matter required in order for these conditions to hold.},

abstract = {The well known transport laws of Navier-Stokes and Fourier fail for the simulation of processes on lengthscales in the order of the mean free path of a particle that is when the Knudsen number is not small enough. Thus, the proper simulation of flows in rarefied gases requires a more detailed description. This book discusses classical and modern methods to derive macroscopic transport equations for rarefied gases from the Boltzmann equation, for small and moderate Knudsen numbers, i.e. at and above the Navier-Stokes-Fourier level. The main methods discussed are the classical Chapman-Enskog and Grad approaches, as well as the new order of magnitude method, which avoids the short-comings of the classical methods, but retains their benefits. The relations between the various methods are carefully examined, and the resulting equations are compared and tested for a variety of standard problems. The book develops the topic starting from the basic description of an ideal gas, over the derivation of the Boltzmann equation, towards the various methods for deriving macroscopic transport equations, and the test problems which include stability of the equations, shock waves, and Couette flow.},

The fluid is modelled by the Oldroyd-B, neo-Hookean, FENE-P, and Saramito EVP models, and the additional equations for the non-Newtonian stresses are fully coupled with the flow. The rigid particles are discretized on a moving Lagrangian grid while the flow equations are solved on a fixed Eulerian grid. The solid particles are represented by an Immersed Boundary method (IBM) with a computationally efficient direct forcing method. The immersed boundary force is computed at the particle surface and then included in the momentum equations as a body force. The droplets and soft particles are simulated in a fully Eulerian framework, the former with a level-set method to capture the moving interface and the latter with an indicator function. The solver is first validated for various benchmark single-phase and two-phase elastoviscoplastic flow problems through comparison with data from the literature. Finally, we present new results on the dynamics of a buoyancy driven drop in an elastoviscoplastic fluid.},

abstract = {Since the 1970's, theories of deformation and failure of amorphous, solidlike materials have started with models in which stress-driven, molecular rearrangements occur at localized flow defects via "shear transformations". This picture is the basis for the modern theory of "shear transformation zones" (STZ's), which is the focus of this review. We begin by describing the structure of the theory in general terms and by showing several applications, specifically: interpretation of stress-strain measurements for a bulk metallic glass, analysis of numerical simulations of shear banding, and the use of the STZ equations of motion in free-boundary calculations. In the second half of this article, we focus for simplicity on what we call an "athermal" model of amorphous plasticity, and use that model to illustrate how the STZ theory emerges within a systematic formulation of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.},

We give an accessible introduction to how to study this smallest and hottest droplet of liquid made on earth and why it is so interesting. The physics of heavy ions ranges from highly energetic quarks and gluons described by perturbative QCD to a bath of strongly interacting gluons at lower energy scales. These gluons quickly thermalize and form QGP, while the energetic partons traverse this plasma and end in a shower of particles called jets. Analyzing the final particles in a variety of different ways allows us to study the properties of QGP and the complex dynamics of multi-scale processes in QCD which govern its formation and evolution, providing what is perhaps the simplest form of complex quantum matter that we know of. Much remains to be understood, and throughout the review big open questions will be encountered.},

abstract = {We characterize ill-posed problems as catastrophically (Hadamard) unstable to short waves. The growth rate tends to infinity as the wavelength tends to zero. The mathematical description of ill-posed problems is framed in terms of instability. These problems cannot be integrated numerically; the finer the mesh, the worse is the result. The instability must be regularized. Ill-posed problems which arise in problems involving interfaces, oil recovery, granular media, and viscoelastic fluids are regularized in different ways, by adding effects of surface tension or viscosity or compressibility or by weakening the initial discontinuity. Problems which are stables t → ∞ for any fixed wavelength $\lambda$, no matter how small, can be Hadamard unstable with catastrophic instability as $\lambda$ → 0 for a fixed t, no matter how large. We stress the utility of freezing coefficients in nonlinear and quasilinear systems and prove that in general ill-posed problems cannot be solved unless the initial data is analytic. We show why the shock up of first-order systems which are nonlinear in first derivatives can be expected to lead to discontinuities in second, rather than first, derivatives},

We outline how numerical methods based on a wave decomposition may be developed, along with the importance of conservation, particularly in the equilibrium regime. The properties of the RHD equations are examined through asymptotic and dispersion analyses. The conditions required to obtain the classical equilibrium limit are rigorously studied. The results show that a simple coupling term developed recently by Morel, which retains a minimum of relativistic corrections, may be sufficient for nonrelativistic flows. We also give two constraints on the relativistic corrections that result in retaining terms on the order of the truncation. In addition, the dispersion results for the P{\_}1 approximation are studied in detail and are compared with both the exact-transport results and a full relativistic treatment. We also examine some nonintuitive behavior in the dispersion results.},

We also argue that these theories appear to have extra degrees of freedom with respect to general relativity. The usual teleparallel Lagrangian, which has been extensively studied and leads to a theory dynamically equivalent to general relativity, is an exception. Both of these facts appear to have been overlooked in the recent literature on f(T) gravity, but are crucial for assessing the viability of these theories as alternative explanations for the acceleration of the universe.},

A lesser known result concerns the existence of a wider class of teleparallel models which also admits these solutions when the spacetime is diagonalizable by means of a coordinate change. However, it is stated by Obukhov and Pereira that the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity is the only teleparallel model which admits black holes. To show that this statement is not true, I present the result of Hayashi and Shirafuji, which proves the existence of this wider class by showing the equivalence between two Lagrangians. It turns out that this equivalence also holds for plane-wave metrics. In addition, I update the constraints on the parameters of the teleparallel models. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Relativistic thermodynamics of degenerate gases is presented here as a field theory of the 14 fields of particle density—particle flux, andstress—energy—momentum. The field equations are based on the conservation laws of particle numbers, and energy-momentum and on a balance of fluxes. The necessary constitutive equations are strongly restricted by the principle of relativity,entropy principle,requirement of hyperbolicity. It turns out that the resulting field equations contain only viscosity, bulk viscosity and heat conductivity as unknown functions. All other constitutive coefficients may be calculated from the equilibrium equations of state that are known from statistical arguments. The paper offers a more systematic version of relativistic thermodynamics of gases than the earlier papers by M{\"{u}}ller and Israel. At the same time the present version contains less unknown functions than those earlier papers. All speeds of propagation are finite. The relation between the present theory and the classical one formulated by Eckart is described.},

@article{Burov2014,
abstract = {The role of mantle-lithosphere interactions in shaping surface topography has long been debated. In general, it is supposed that mantle plumes and vertical mantle flows result in axisymmetric, long-wavelength topography, which strongly differs from the generally asymmetric short-wavelength topography created by intraplate tectonic forces. However, identification of mantle-induced topography is difficult, especially in the continents. It can be argued therefore that complex brittle-ductile rheology and stratification of the continental lithosphere result in short-wavelength modulation and localization of deformation induced by mantle flow. This deformation should also be affected by far-field stresses and, hence, interplay with the 'tectonic' topography (for example, in the 'active/passive' rifting scenario). Testing these ideas requires fully coupled three-dimensional numerical modelling of mantle-lithosphere interactions, which so far has not been possible owing to the conceptual and technical limitations of earlier approaches. Here we present new, ultra-high-resolution, three-dimensional numerical experiments on topography over mantle plumes, incorporating a weakly pre-stressed (ultra-slow spreading), rheologically realistic lithosphere. The results show complex surface evolution, which is very different from the smooth, radially symmetric patterns usually assumed as the canonical surface signature of mantle upwellings. In particular, the topography exhibits strongly asymmetric, small-scale, three-dimensional features, which include narrow and wide rifts, flexural flank uplifts and fault structures. This suggests a dominant role for continental rheological structure and intra-plate stresses in controlling dynamic topography, mantle-lithosphere interactions, and continental break-up processes above mantle plumes.},

Taking the well-known inertial number I as a measure of sheared-induced local fluidization, we derive a relaxation model for I according to the evolution of microstructure during avalanche and dissipation processes. The model yields a nonmonotonic flow law for a homogeneous flow, accounting for hysteretic solid-fluid transition and intermittency in quasistatic flows. For an inhomogeneous flow, the model predicts a generalized Bagnold shear stress revealing the interplay of two microscopic nonlocal mechanisms: collisions among correlated structures and the diffusion of fluidization within the structures. In describing a uniform flow down an incline, the model reproduces the hysteretic starting and stopping heights and the Pouliquen flow rule for mean velocity. Moreover, a dimensionless parameter reflecting the nonlocal effect on the flow is discovered, which controls the transition between Bagnold and creeping flow dynamics.},

abstract = {Transition from laminar to turbulent flow drastically changes the mixing, transport, and drag properties of fluids, yet when and how turbulence emerges is elusive even for simple flow within pipes and rectangular channels. Unlike the onset of temporal disorder, which is identified as the universal route to chaos in confined flows, characterization of the onset of spatio-temporal disorder has been an outstanding challenge because turbulent domains irregularly decay or spread as they propagate downstream. Here, through extensive experimental investigation of channel flow, we identify a distinctive transition with critical behavior. Turbulent domains continuously injected from an inlet ultimately decayed, or in contrast, spread depending on flow rates. Near a transition point, critical behavior was observed. We investigate both spatial and temporal dynamics of turbulent clusters, measuring four critical exponents, a universal scaling function and a scaling relation, all in agreement with the (2+1)-dimensional directed percolation universality class.},

abstract = {We present a consistent and complete description of the coupling to matter in the Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (TEGR) theory built from a Cartan connection, as we proposed in previous works. A first theorem allows us to obtain parallel transport from the Cartan connection into a proper Ehresmann connection, while a second ensures to link the TEGR-Cartan connection to the Ehresmann one-form that contains the Levi-Civita connection. This yields a coupling to matter in agreement with observations and the Equivalence Principle. As the fundamental fields proceed from the Cartan connection, if one insists on interpreting TEGR as a gauge theory of translations, such translation gauge field can be extracted from the consistent theory presented. However, this would entail a fundamental change in the structures known for gauge theory and a split between gauge field and connection is imperative. The willingness to take such a step is left to the reader.},

@article{Marmanis1998,
abstract = {A new theory of turbulence is initiated, based on the analogy between electromagnetism and turbulent hydrodynamics, for the purpose of describing the dynamical behavior of averaged flow quantities in incompressible fluid flows of high Reynolds numbers. The starting point is the recognition that the vorticity (wu) and the Lamb vector (lwu) should be taken as the kernel of a dynamical theory of turbulence. The governing equations for these fields can be obtained by the Navier-Stokes equations, which underlie the whole evolution. Then whatever parts are not explicitly expressed as a function of w or l only are gathered and treated as source terms. This is done by introducing the concepts of turbulent charge and turbulent current. Thus we are led to a closed set of linear equations for the averaged field quantities. The premise is that the earlier introduced sources will be apt for modeling, in the sense that their distribution will depend only on the geometry and the total energetics of the flow. The dynamics described in the preceding manner is what we call the metafluid dynamics.},

@article{Kwon1995,
abstract = {This paper discusses the criteria for both global Hadamard and dissipative stabilities of viscoelastic constitutive equations (CEs) with instantaneous elasticity. In order to formulate as generally as possible the conditions of stability analyses, we used some unified forms for CEs of differential Maxwell-like and factorable single integral types. The obtained criteria formulate the constraints which have to be imposed on parameters or functions in CEs to avoid the unphysical instabilities in the whole range of Deborah numbers, independent of the flow situation. The problem of Hadamard stability for the viscoelastic CEs is reduced to that well known in the theory of nonlinear elasticity where the complete solution of the problem was found recently in an algebraic form. The criteria of dissipative stability, which have been established previously, are also discussed. When applied to many popular viscoelastic models, the combined stability criteria impose a set of such severe constraints that no single integral CE with time-strain separability proposed in the literature, could satisfy them, and only few differential models have proved to be stable. ?? 1995.},

@article{Michael2018a,
abstract = {We propose a numerical methodology for the numerical simulation of distinct, interacting physical processes described by a combination of compressible, inert and reactive forms of the Euler equations, multiphase equations and elastoplastic equations. These systems of equations are usually solved by coupling finite element and CFD models. Here we solve them simultaneously, by recasting all the equations in the same, hyperbolic form and solving them on the same grid with the same finite-volume numerical schemes. The proposed compressible, multiphase, hydrodynamic formulation can employ a hierarchy of five reactive and non-reactive flow models, which allows simple to more involved applications to be directly described by the appropriate selection. The communication between the hydrodynamic and elastoplastic systems is facilitated by means of mixed-material Riemann solvers at the boundaries of the systems, which represent physical material boundaries. To this end we derive approximate mixed Riemann solvers for each pair of the above models based on characteristic equations. The components for reactive flow and elastoplastic solid modelling are validated separately before presenting validation for the full, coupled systems. Multi-dimensional use cases demonstrate the suitability of the reactive flow-solid interaction methodology in the context of impact-driven initiation of reactive flow and structural response due to violent reaction in automotive (e.g. car crash) or defence (e.g. explosive reactive armour) applications. Several types of explosives (C4, Detasheet, nitromethane, gaseous fuel) in gaseous, liquid and solid state are considered.},

@article{Ortigosa2016,
abstract = {The series of papers published by Gil and Ortigosa (Gil and Ortigosa, 2016; Ortigosa and Gil, 2016, 0000) introduced a new convex multi-variable variational and computational framework for the numerical simulation of Electro Active Polymers (EAPs) in scenarios characterised by extreme deformations and/or extreme electric fields. Building upon this body of work, five key novelties are incorporated in this paper. First, a generalisation of the concept of multi-variable convexity to energy functionals additively decomposed into isochoric and volumetric components. This decomposition is typical of nearly and truly incompressible materials, group which represents the majority of the most relevant EAPs. Second, convexification or regularisation strategies are applied to a priori non-convex multi-variable isochoric functionals to yield physically meaningful convex multi-variable functionals. Third, based on the mixed variational principles introduced in Gil and Ortigosa (2016) in the context of compressible electro-elasticity, a novel extended Hu???Washizu mixed variational principle for nearly and truly incompressible scenarios is presented. From the computational standpoint, a static condensation procedure is applied in order to condense out the element-wise extra fields, the resulting formulation having a comparable cost to the more standard three-field displacement-potential-pressure mixed formulation. Fourth, the computational framework for the three-field mixed variational principle in nearly and truly incompressible scenarios is also presented. In this case, the novelty resides in the consideration of convex multi-variable energy functionals. Ultimately, this leads to the definition of new tangent operators for the Helmholtz's energy functional in the specific context of incompressible electro-elasticity. Fifth, a Petrov???Galerkin stabilisation technique is applied on the three-field formulation for the circumvention of the Ladyz??enskaja???Babus??ka???Brezzi (LBB) condition, enabling the use of linear tetrahedral finite elements for the interpolation of the unknowns of the problem. Finally, a series of challenging numerical examples is presented in order to provide an exhaustive comparison of the different variational formulations presented in this paper.},

One of the best-known examples of upscaling is the calculation of absolute and relative permeability of reservoir rocks. This contribution presents a complete work-flow for setting up pore-scale simulations, starting from the micro-CT of a (in general small) porous sample.

We then discuss progress to model microstructures on a continuum scale using phase-field methods. We focus on selected examples in which modeling of 3D cellular and dendritic microstructures has been directly linked to experimental observations. Finally, we discuss a recently introduced coarse-grained dendritic needle network approach to simulate the formation of well-developed dendritic microstructures. This approach reliably bridges the well-separated scales traditionally simulated by phase-field and grain structure models, hence opening new avenues for quantitative modeling of complex intra- and inter-grain dynamical interactions on a grain scale.

@article{Jeong1995,
abstract = {Considerable confusion surrounds the longstanding question of what constitutes a vortex, especially in a turbulent flow. This question, frequently misunderstood as academic, has recently acquired particular significance since coherent structures (CS) in turbulent flows are now commonly regarded as vortices. An objective definition of a vortex should permit the use of vortex dynamics concepts to educe CS, to explain formation and evolutionary dynamics of CS, to explore the role of CS in turbulence phenomena, and to develop viable turbulence models and control strategies for turbulence phenomena. We propose a definition of a vortex in an incompressible flow in terms of the eigenvalues of the symmetric tensor S 2 + a 2 ; here S and 0 are respectively the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor Vu. This definition captures the pressure minimum in a plane perpendicular to the vortex axis at high Reynolds numbers, and also accurately defines vortex cores at low Reynolds numbers, unlike a pressure-minimum criterion. We compare our definition with prior schemes/definitions using exact and numerical solutions of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for a variety of laminar and turbulent flows. In contrast to definitions based on the positive second invariant of V u or the complex eigenvalues of Vu, our definition accurately identifies the vortex core in flows where the vortex geometry is intuitively clear.},

@article{Munz2016,
abstract = {Scale-resolving simulations of turbulent flows in complex domains demand accurate and efficient numerical schemes, as well as geometrical flexibility. For underresolved situations, the avoidance of aliasing errors is a strong demand for stability. For continuous and discontinuous Galerkin schemes, an effective way to prevent aliasing errors is to increase the quadrature precision of the projection operator to account for the non-linearity of the operands (polynomial dealiasing, overintegration). But this increases the computational costs extensively. In this work, we present a novel spatially and temporally adaptive dealiasing strategy by projection filtering. We show this to be more efficient for underresolved turbulence than the classical overintegration strategy. For this novel approach, we discuss the implementation strategy and the indicator details, show its accuracy and efficiency for a decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence and the transitional Taylor–Green vortex and compare it to the original overintegration approach and a state of the art variational multi-scale eddy viscosity formulation.},

abstract = {Pore-scale forces have a significant effect on the macroscopic behaviour of multiphase flow through porous media. This paper studies the effect of these forces using a new volume-of-fluid based finite volume method developed for simulating two-phase flow directly on micro-CT images of porous media. An analytical analysis of the relationship between the pore-scale forces and the Darcy-scale pressure drops is presented. We use this analysis to propose unambiguous definitions of Darcy-scale viscous pressure drops as the rate of energy dissipation per unit flow rate of each phase, and then use them to obtain the relative permeability curves. We show that this definition is consistent with conventional laboratory/field measurements by comparing our predictions with experimental relative permeability. We present single and two-phase flow simulations for primary oil injection followed by water injection on a sandpack and a Berea sandstone. The two-phase flow simulations are presented at different capillary numbers which cover the transition from capillary fingering at low capillary numbers to a more viscous fingering displacement pattern at higher capillary numbers, and the effect of capillary number on the relative permeability curves is investigated. Overall, this paper presents a new finite volume-based methodology for the detailed analysis of two-phase flow directly on micro-CT images of porous media and upscaling of the results to the Darcy scale.},

An overview on the governing equations is given and the numerical method is shortly discussed.

The numerical results on static meshes agree well with analytical solutions and experimental/numerical results from literature. Also, first 3D finite-volume simulations with adaptive mesh refinement near the interface are presented as a key element to achieve CPU-time efficient simulations.},

Subsequently, we review a number of different SPH formulations of Newtonian, special- and general relativistic ideal fluid dynamics. We particularly point out recent developments that increase the accuracy of SPH with respect to commonly used techniques. The second main part of the review is dedicated to the application of SPH in compact object simulations. We discuss encounters between two white dwarfs, between two neutron stars and between a neutron star and a stellar-mass black hole. For each type of system, the main focus is on the more common, gravitational wave-driven binary mergers, but we also discuss dynamical collisions as they occur in dense stellar systems such as cores of globular clusters.},

These quantities are constructed with the help of the Nijenhuis tensor, which in turn is defined in terms of a (1,1) tensor {\$}S{\^{}}\backslashlambda{\_}\backslashmu{\$}. This tensor enters the construction of the distorted torsion tensor. We use this tensor to extend the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) into a theory defined by the tetrad fields and by the tensor {\$}S{\^{}}\backslashlambda{\_}\backslashmu{\$}. The ordinary TEGR is recovered if {\$}S{\^{}}\backslashlambda{\_}\backslashmu=\backslashdelta{\^{}}\backslashlambda{\_}\backslashmu{\$}. We consider the flat space-time formulation of the theory, in terms of {\$}S{\^{}}\backslashlambda{\_}\backslashmu{\$} only, and show that this tensor satisfies the wave equation for massless spin 2 fields.},

@article{Yang2016,
abstract = {Multiple numerical approaches have been developed to simulate porous media fluid flow and solute transport at the pore scale. These include 1) methods that explicitly model the three-dimensional geometry of pore spaces and 2) methods that conceptualize the pore space as a topologically consistent set of stylized pore bodies and pore throats. In previous work we validated a model of the first type, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes employing a standard finite volume method (FVM), against magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) measurements of pore-scale velocities. Here we expand that validation to include additional models of the first type based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), as well as a model of the second type, a pore-network model (PNM). The PNM approach used in the current study was recently improved and demonstrated to accurately simulate solute transport in a two-dimensional experiment. While the PNM approach is computationally much less demanding than direct numerical simulation methods, the effect of conceptualizing complex three-dimensional pore geometries on solute transport in the manner of PNMs has not been fully determined. We apply all four approaches (FVM-based CFD, LBM, SPH and PNM) to simulate pore-scale velocity distributions and (for capable codes) nonreactive solute transport, and intercompare the model results. Comparisons are drawn both in terms of macroscopic variables (e.g., permeability, solute breakthrough curves) and microscopic variables (e.g., local velocities and concentrations). Generally good agreement was achieved among the various approaches, but some differences were observed depending on the model context. The intercomparison work was challenging because of variable capabilities of the codes, and inspired some code enhancements to allow consistent comparison of flow and transport simulations across the full suite of methods. This study provides support for confidence in a variety of pore-scale modeling methods and motivates further development and application of pore-scale simulation methods.},

abstract = {This article deals with the Hadamard instability of the so-called {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D707{\}}(I){\$} model of dense rapidly sheared granular flow, as reported recently by Barker et al. ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 779, 2015, pp. 794–818). The present paper presents a more comprehensive study of the linear stability of planar simple shearing and pure shearing flows, with account taken of convective Kelvin wavevector stretching by the base flow. We provide a closed-form solution for the linear-stability problem and show that wavevector stretching leads to asymptotic stabilization of the non-convective instability found by Barker et al. ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 779, 2015, pp. 794–818). We also explore the stabilizing effects of higher velocity gradients achieved by an enhanced-continuum model based on a dissipative analogue of the van der Waals–Cahn–Hilliard equation of equilibrium thermodynamics. This model involves a dissipative hyperstress, as the analogue of a special Korteweg stress, with surface viscosity representing the counterpart of elastic surface tension. Based on the enhanced-continuum model, we also present a model of steady shear bands and their nonlinear stability against parallel shearing. Finally, we propose a theoretical connection between the non-convective instability of Barker et al. ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 779, 2015, pp. 794–818) and the loss of generalized ellipticity in the quasi-static field equations. Apart from the theoretical interest, the present work may suggest stratagems for the numerical simulation of continuum field equations involving the {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D707{\}}(I){\$} rheology and variants thereof.},

abstract = {In this paper, we exploit some results in the theory of irreversible phenomena to address the study of quasi-static brittle fracture propagation in a two-dimensional isotropic continuum. The elastic strain energy density of the body has been assumed to be geometrically nonlinear and to depend on the strain gradient. Such generalized continua often arise in the description of microstructured media. These materials possess an intrinsic length scale, which determines the size of internal boundary layers. In particular, the non-locality conferred by this internal length scale avoids the concentration of deformations, which is usually observed when dealing with local models and which leads to mesh dependency. A scalar Lagrangian damage field, ranging from zero to one, is introduced to describe the internal state of structural degradation of the material. Standard Lam{\'{e}} and second-gradient elastic coefficients are all assumed to decrease as damage increases and to be locally zero if the value attained by damage is one. This last situation is associated with crack formation and/or propagation. Numerical solutions of the model are provided in the case of an obliquely notched rectangular specimen subjected to monotonous tensile and shear loading tests, and brittle fracture propagation is discussed.},

@article{Hehl2007,
abstract = {We review the application of torsion in field theory. First we show how the notion of torsion emerges in differential geometry. In the context of a Cartan circuit, torsion is related to translations similar as curvature to rotations. Cartan's investigations started by analyzing Einsteins general relativity theory and by taking recourse to the theory of Cosserat continua. In these continua, the points of which carry independent translational and rotational degrees of freedom, there occur, besides ordinary (force) stresses, additionally spin moment stresses. In a 3-dimensional "continuized" (Kr{\"{o}}ner) crystal with dislocation lines, a linear connection can be introduced that takes the crystal lattice structure as a basis for parallelism. Such a continuum has similar properties as a Cosserat continuum, and the dislocation density is equal to the torsion of this connection. Subsequently, these ideas are applied to 4-dimensional spacetime. A translational gauge theory of gravity is displayed (in a Weitzenb{\"{o}}ck or teleparallel spacetime) as well as the viable Einstein-Cartan theory (in a Riemann-Cartan spacetime). In both theories, the notion of torsion is contained in an essential way. Cartan's spiral staircase is described as a 3-dimensional Euclidean model for a space with torsion, and eventually some controversial points are discussed regarding the meaning of torsion.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} In this paper we present a 2D/3D high order accurate finite volume scheme in the context of direct Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian algorithms for general hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations with non-conservative products and stiff source terms. This scheme is constructed with a single stencil polynomial reconstruction operator, a one-step space-time ADER integration which is suitably designed for dealing even with stiff sources, a nodal solver with relaxation to determine the mesh motion, a path-conservative integration technique for the treatment of non-conservative products and an {\textless}italic{\textgreater}a posteriori{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} stabilization procedure derived from the so-called Multidimensional Optimal Order Detection (MOOD) paradigm. In this work we consider the seven equation Baer-Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flows as a representative model involving non-conservative products as well as relaxation source terms which are allowed to become stiff. The new scheme is validated against a set of test cases on 2D/3D unstructured moving meshes on parallel machines and the high order of accuracy achieved by the method is demonstrated by performing a numerical convergence study. Classical Riemann problems and explosion problems with exact solutions are simulated in 2D and 3D. The overall numerical code is also profiled to provide an estimate of the computational cost required by each component of the whole algorithm. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It is well known that modified gravity models based on the torsion scalar are not invariant under local Lorentz transformations while modifications based on the Ricci scalar are. This motivates the study of a model depending on the torsion scalar and the divergence of the torsion vector. We derive the teleparallel equivalent of {\$}f(R){\$} gravity as a particular subset of these models and also show that this is the unique theory in this class that is invariant under local Lorentz transformation. Furthermore one can show that {\$}f(T){\$} gravity is the unique theory admitting second order field equations.},

abstract = {A fundamental understanding of flow in porous media at the pore-scale is necessary to be able to upscale average displacement processes from core to reservoir scale. The study of fluid flow in porous media at the pore-scale consists of two key procedures: Imaging - reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) pore space images; and modelling such as with single and two-phase flow simulations with Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) or Pore-Network (PN) Modelling. Here we analyse pore-scale results to predict petrophysical properties such as porosity, single-phase permeability and multi-phase properties at different length scales. The fundamental issue is to understand the image resolution dependency of transport properties, in order to up-scale the flow physics from pore to core scale. In this work, we use a high resolution micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scanner to image and reconstruct three dimensional pore-scale images of five sandstones (Bentheimer, Berea, Clashach, Doddington and Stainton) and five complex carbonates (Ketton, Estaillades, Middle Eastern sample 3, Middle Eastern sample 5 and Indiana Limestone 1) at four different voxel resolutions (4.4 µm, 6.2 µm, 8.3 µm and 10.2 µm), scanning the same physical field of view. Implementing three phase segmentation (macro-pore phase, intermediate phase and grain phase) on pore-scale images helps to understand the importance of connected macro-porosity in the fluid flow for the samples studied. We then compute the petrophysical properties for all the samples using PN and LB simulations in order to study the influence of voxel resolution on petrophysical properties. We then introduce a numerical coarsening scheme which is used to coarsen a high voxel resolution image (4.4 µm) to lower resolutions (6.2 µm, 8.3 µm and 10.2 µm) and study the impact of coarsening data on macroscopic and multi-phase properties. Numerical coarsening of high resolution data is found to be superior to using a lower resolution scan because it avoids the problem of partial volume effects and reduces the scaling effect by preserving the pore-space properties influencing the transport properties. This is evidently compared in this study by predicting several pore network properties such as number of pores and throats, average pore and throat radius and coordination number for both scan based analysis and numerical coarsened data.},

abstract = {The fluidized bed is a technology that involves multiple phases, allowing for efficient con-tact between them, therefore it is widely used in the chemical industry, metallurgy, oil and thermal power generation. In fluidized bed processes, the gas–solid interactions and chem-ical reactions generate a large number of variables to be handled, making the process very complex. Therefore, fluidized bed modeling and simulation is widely used to predict and analyze different processes, but it is possible to find in the literature many mathematical correlations that describe this type of flow. Based on this, the present work presents a review of the main mathematical models that describe the behavior of a fluidized bed reactor, and the state of the art regarding the use of modeling and simulation of the bed to predict and analyze different processes. As a result of this review, we can observe the importance of fur-ther development of the hydrodynamic modeling of fluidized beds, where understanding the interactions between the phases and the influence of this interaction is crucial for a bet-ter understanding and control of the processes. Generating experimental data of gas–solid and solid–solid interactions is also required for the validation of the numerical models.},

abstract = {Selective laser melting is receiving increasing interest as an additive manufacturing technique. Residual stresses induced by the large temperature gradients and inhomogeneous cooling process can favour the generation of cracks. In this work, a crystal plasticity finite element model is developed to simulate the formation of residual stresses and to understand the correlation between plastic deformation, grain orientation and residual stresses in the additive manufacturing process. The temperature profile and grain structure from the thermal-fluid flow and grain growth simulations are implemented into the crystal plasticity model. An element elimination and reactivation method is proposed to model the melting and solidification and to reinitialise state variables, such as the plastic deformation, in the reactivated elements; it represents a step forward compared with previous methods based on the stiffness degradation of liquid regions. The method is used to investigate residual stresses parallel and perpendicular to the laser scan direction, and the correlation with the maximum Schmid factor of the grains along those directions. The magnitude of the residual stress can be predicted as a function of the depth, grain orientation and position with respect to the molten pool.},

abstract = {Preface These notes have evolved over many years and are offered freely to students and researchers everywhere. In my own personal history I came from rather humble beginnings, and was the beneficiary of very generous scholarship and fellowship support, even with books provided. Without this generosity on the part of the taxpayers of the State of Maryland, the USA Federal Goverment and the Johns Hopkins University, I could never be where I am today. So these notes are my gift to all those who come behind, and especially those who find the cost of most books to be a real financial struggle. If you reference them, please refer to the website where others can find them (www.turbulence-online.com). They will probably never stop evolving, so it might be a good idea to check once in a while for updated versions. These notes actually started as book on turbulence I was writing in the early 1980's, and which was nearly finished and ready to be published. I had taught turbulence classes for more than a decade (at SUNY/Buffalo) and thought I had found a way to improve the available texts. Fortunately (or unfortunately for publication), one day I ended up in class without my notes, and in trying to answer questions asked to me by the class, I ended up in a very different place than I expected. Some of the results have been published in various places, and some are referred to herein. But it was clear to me from the very first moment that the book had to go: I no longer believed to be true what I was saying in it. The last 30 years have been an interesting journey as successive waves of students have asked even more difficult questions, and as I wrestled to figure out what was true and not true. I have tried in these notes to provide to the best of my ability an honest account of turbulence and what I think we know for sure and what we do not. I remember despairing as a student that it seemed that all the problems were solved, and there was really nothing fundamental left to do. I doubt any careful reader of these notes will come to that erroneous conclusion. The goal was not to be comprehensive, so there is much left out. But instead the goal is to inspire continued study, and to provide a foundation for it. I have also tried to make these notes fun to read. If you are expecting a totally serious account, you will probably be disappointd. I have included my opinions when I thought it would help in understanding, and also anedotes when I could think of them. The point is that turbulence (like all research) is done by people. It is probably true that the ones who do the best work are also having the most fun. I hope the newcomers to the field find that inspirational. Please do not hesitate to ask me questions or point out places where I have screwed up. My email address is georgewilliamk@gmail.com. Whenever possible I will try to respond.},

abstract = {Different possible mechanisms of non-Newtonian behavior of polymeric and multi-component materials in shearing are discussed. There are two main types of the non-Newtonian media: fluids with the maximal (zero-shear-rate) Newtonian viscosity and yielding visco-plastic materials. Numerous intermediate and superimposing situations can also exist. The main concept of the non-Newtonian viscosity of such elastic fluids as polymer melts is based on definition of their “structure” as the set of relaxation modes modified by deformation. Shear-induced relaxation spectrum transformations lead to non-linearity, formation of anisotropic structures, and changes in the macromolecule entanglement topology. A general approach to quantitative description of non-Newtonian flow of polymer melts is achieved if to assume that the dominant reason of non-linear flow properties is molecular-weight distribution of polydisperse polymers with continuous flow-to rubbery transition from the side of slow relaxation modes with increasing shear rate. The non-Newtonian viscosity of such multi-component systems as numerous suspensions, emulsions, and mixtures is characterized by transition from the flow curves with the zero-shear-rate viscosity to the yield-type behavior. The latter is the direct evidence of a spatial structure which changes in shearing. The yield stress value can be rigorously determined only for rigid structures. For soft matters, the structural breakdown/buildup processes are a time dependent (thixotropic/rheopectic) phenomenon, and the concept of yielding becomes uncertain. Nature of structures in various multi-component materials can be very different but just their existence determines a possibility of non-linear effects in shearing. A special type of the non-Newtonian flow is instability and inhomogeneity of a stream. Different forms of these phenomena (shear banding, layered flow, surface distortions, periodic oscillations, concentration separation, and movement of large structural aggregates) are known. In such situations, the “measured” non-Newtonian viscosity can appear an artifact depending on the size factor.},

@article{Spin2010,
abstract = {In this work, we employ a combination of high-speed imaging and schlieren imaging, as well as multiphysics modelling, to elucidate the effects of the interaction between the laser beam and the powder bed. The formation of denuded areas where the powder was removed during single line and island scans over several layers were imaged for the first time. The inclination of the laser plume was shifted from forwards to backwards by changing power and scan speed, resulting in different denudation regimes with implications to the heat, mass and momentum transfer of the process. As the build progressed, denudation became less severe than for a single powder layer, but the occurrence of sintered and fused powder agglomerates, which were affected by the plume, increased. Schlieren imaging enabled the visualisation of the Ar gas flow, which takes place in the atmosphere above the bed due to the plume, in addition to its interaction with affected particles. Numerical modelling was used to understand and quantify the observed flow behaviour, through the hydrodynamic treatment of the laser plume as a multi-component Ar-Fe plasma. These results promote the characterisation of fluid dynamic phenomena during the laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) process, which constitutes a key factor in the prevention of defects in additively manufactured parts.},

Here, I use these equations to model several classic examples in fluid mechanics, with the intention of providing a general sense of comparison between the two approaches. A few broad facts emerge: (1) it is as simple--or in most cases, much simpler--to find solutions with the M(D,{\{}$\backslash$eta{\}})-formulation, (2) for some examples, there is not much of a difference in predictions--in fact, for sound propagation and for examples in which there is only a rotational part of the velocity, my transport coefficients D and {\{}$\backslash$eta{\}} are chosen to match Navier-Stokes-Fourier solutions in the appropriate regimes, (3) there are, however, examples in which pronounced differences in predictions appear, such as light scattering, and (4) there arise, moreover, important conceptual differences, as seen in examples like sound at a non-infinite impedance boundary, thermophoresis, and gravity's effect on the atmosphere.},

The temperature, energy density and entropy evolution are investigated in the framework of the Bjorken boost--invariant scaling limit. The results of these second order theories are compared to those of first order theories due to Eckart and to Landau and Lifshitz and those of zeroth order (perfect fluid) due to Euler. In the presence of dissipation perfect fluid dynamics is no longer valid in describing the evolution of the matter. First order theories fail in the early stages of evolution. Second order theories give a better description in good agreement with transport models. It is shown in which region the Navier--Stokes--Fourier laws (first order theories) are a reasonable limiting case of the more general extended thermodynamics (second order theories).},

From the point of view of the gauge principle of Weyl and Yang-Mills-Utiyama, it became manifest around the 1960s (Sciama--Kibble) that gravity is closely related to the Poincare group acting in Minkowski space. The gauging of this external group induces a Riemann-Cartan geometry on spacetime. If one generalizes the gauge group of gravity, one finds still more involved spacetime geometries. If one specializes it to the translation group, one finds a specific Riemann-Cartan geometry with teleparallelism (Weitzenbock geometry).},

This system aims to model two-species phase segregation on an atomic lattice (Podio-Guidugli, 2006 [19]); in the balance equations of microforces and microenergy, the two unknowns are the order parameter $\rho$ and the chemical potential $\mu$. A simpler version of the same system has recently been discussed in Colli et al. (2011) [8]. In this paper, a fairly more general phase-field equation for $\rho$ is coupled with a genuinely nonlinear diffusion equation for $\mu$. The existence of a global-in-time solution is proved with the help of suitable a priori estimates. In the case of a constant atom mobility, a new and rather unusual uniqueness proof is given, based on a suitable combination of variables. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a new method of achieving topologically protected states in a discrete hexagonal lattice by attaching gyroscopic spinners, which bring chirality to the system. Dispersive features of this medium are investigated in detail and, by tuning the parameters of the spinners, it is shown one can manipulate the locations of stop-bands and Dirac points. We show that in proximity of such points, uni-directional interfacial waveforms can be created in an inhomogeneous lattice and the direction of such waveforms can be controlled. The effect of inserting additional internal links into the system, which is thus transformed in a heterogeneous triangular lattice, is also investigated. This work introduces a new perspective in the design of periodic media possessing non-trivial topological features.},

abstract = {The Herschel–Bulkley rheological fluid model includes terms representing viscosity and plasticity. In this classical model, below the yield stress the material is strictly rigid. Complementing this model by including elastic behavior below the yield stress leads to a description of an elastoviscoplastic (EVP) material such as an emulsion or a liquid foam. We include this modification in a completely tensorial description of cylindrical Couette shear flows. Both the EVP model parameters, at the scale of a representative volume element, and the predictions (velocity, strain and stress fields) can be readily compared with experiments. We perform a detailed study of the effect of the main parameters, especially the yield strain. We discuss the role of the curvature of the cylindrical Couette geometry in the appearance of localization; we determine the value of the localization length and provide an approximate analytical expression. We then show that, in this tensorial EVP model of cylindrical Couette shear flow, the normal stress difference strongly influences the velocity profiles, which can be smooth or nonsmooth according to the initial conditions on the stress. This feature could explain several open questions regarding experimental measurements on Couette flows for various EVP materials such as emulsions or liquid foams, including the nonreproducibility that has been reported in flows of foams. We then discuss the suitability of Couette flows as a way to measure rheological properties of EVP materials.},

abstract = {The key paradigm of digital rock physics (DRP) "image and compute" implies imaging and digitizing the pore space and mineral matrix of natural rock and then numerically simulating various physical processes in this digital object to obtain such macroscopic rock properties as permeability, electrical conductivity, and elastic moduli. The steps of this process include image acquisition, image processing (noise reduction, smoothing, and segmentation); setting up the numerical experiment (object size and resolution as well as the boundary conditions); and numerically solving the field equations. Finally, we need to interpret the solution thus obtained in terms of the desired macroscopic properties. For each of these DRP steps, there is more than one method and implementation. Our goal is to explore and record the variability of the computed effective properties as a function of using different tools and workflows. Such benchmarking is the topic of the two present companion papers. Here, in the first part, we introduce four 3D microstructures, a segmented Fontainebleau sandstone sample (porosity 0.147), a gray-scale Berea sample; a gray-scale Grosmont carbonate sample; and a numerically constructed pack of solid spheres (porosity 0.343). Segmentation of the gray-scale images by three independent teams reveals the uncertainty of this process: the segmented porosity range is between 0.184 and 0.209 for Berea and between 0.195 and 0.271 for the carbonate. The implications of the uncertainty associated with image segmentation are explored in a second paper. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Staron2010,
abstract = {In order to test the rheology of granular flows, we performed series of numerical simulations of nearly monodisperse stationary chute flows from rapid to slow and very slow flow regime, namely, close to the jamming transition. We check how existing rheological models (i.e., Bagnold's model and the I-model) capture the behavior of the numerical flows, and perform an acute characterization of the structure of the flow in terms of grains velocity fluctuations close to the jamming transition. The simulations show that both Bagnold's and the I-model fail to describe the data points in the slow regime, namely, when I≤2×10 -2 . Turning to the analysis of grains velocity fluctuations, we compute the associated correlation length $\lambda$ and show its dependence on the inertial number: $\lambda$/d∝I -0.32 . The amplitude of the grains velocity fluctuations, namely, the granular temperature, exhibits a power-law dependence on the shear rate and allows for an efficient prediction of the shape of the velocity profiles. The main result consists of a scaling merging all data points for all flow regimes onto the same master curve, and relating granular temperature, shear rate, and the variation of stress between the considered depth and the bottom wall. This scaling can be written as a relation between local stress, local shear rate, and local temperature, provided the introduction of a characteristic length scale $\xi$=d(H-z)/z where both the distance to the surface and the distance to the bottom wall are involved. This scaling strongly suggests a nonlocal behavior, valid in the flow regime and extending close to the jamming transition, and hints at granular temperature as the variable at the origin of the nonlocality. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Daviet2016,
abstract = {Understanding the flow of granular materials is of utmost importance for numerous industrial applications including the manufacturing, storing and transportation of grain assemblies (such as cement, pills, or corn), as well as for natural risk assessing considerations. Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) methods, which explicitly represent grain-grain interactions, allow for highly-tunable and precise simulations, but they suffer from a prohibitive computational cost when attempting to reproduce large scale scenarios. Continuum models have been recently investigated to overcome such scalability issues, but their numerical simulation still poses many challenges. In this work we propose a novel numerical framework for the continuous simulation of dilatable materials with pressure-dependent (Coulomb) yield stress. Relying upon convex optimization tools, we show that such a macroscopic, nonsmooth rheology can be interpreted as the exact analogous of the solid frictional contact problem at the heart of DEM methods, extended to the tensorial space. Combined with a carefully chosen finite-element discretization, this new framework allows us to avoid regularizing the continuum rheology while benefiting from the efficiency of nonsmooth optimization solvers, mainly leveraged by DEM methods so far. Our numerical results successfully compare to analytic solutions on model problems, and we retrieve qualitative flow features commonly observed in reported experiments of the literature.},

@article{Po2018,
abstract = {We develop a non-singular theory of three-dimensional dislocation loops in a particular version of Mindlin's anisotropic gradient elasticity with up to six length scale parameters. The theory is systematically developed as a generalization of the classical anisotropic theory in the framework of linearized incompatible elasticity. The non-singular version of all key equations of anisotropic dislocation theory are derived as line integrals, including the Burgers displacement equation with isolated solid angle, the Peach-Koehler stress equation, the Mura-Willis equation for the elastic distortion, and the Peach-Koehler force. The expression for the interaction energy between two dislocation loops as a double line integral is obtained directly, without the use of a stress function. It is shown that all the elastic fields are non-singular, and that they converge to their classical counterparts a few characteristic lengths away from the dislocation core. In practice, the non-singular fields can be obtained from the classical ones by replacing the classical (singular) anisotropic Green's tensor with the non-singular anisotropic Green's tensor derived by Lazar and Po (2015b). The elastic solution is valid for arbitrary anisotropic media. In addition to the classical anisotropic elastic constants, the non-singular Green's tensor depends on a second order symmetric tensor of length scale parameters modeling a weak non-locality, whose structure depends on the specific class of crystal symmetry. The anisotropic Helmholtz operator defined by such tensor admits a Green's function which is used as the spreading function for the Burgers vector density. As a consequence, the Burgers vector density spreads differently in different crystal structures. Two methods are proposed to determine the tensor of length scale parameters, based on independent atomistic calculations of classical and gradient elastic constants. The anisotropic non-singular theory is shown to be in good agreement with molecular statics without fitting parameters, and unlike its singular counterpart, the sign of stress components does not show reversal as the core is approached. Compared to the isotropic solution, the difference in the energy density per unit length between edge and screw dislocations is more pronounced.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to provide a complete theoretical and experimental study of shear rheology for concentrated dispersed systems in low molecular weight matrices. A new theoretical approach based on qualitative microstructural physics and thermodynamical arguments is devel- oped which considers flow, elastic deformations, ruptures and restorations of flocs. The approach was developed to study steady and transient phenomena and has predicted very different behaviours for various systems; one of them was a non-monotonic flow curve. The most remarkable feature of the theoretical model is that it contains no mathematical yield criterion but predicts anisotropic yield values with continuous transition from solid state to flow as a bifurcation. A complete set of experiments in simple shearing was carried out for two different dispersed systems: a granular grease and a water-clay platelet mixture. Also some disturbing phenomena were observed and experimental techniques were developed which made it possible to obtain reliable results. Additionally the clay-water system exhibited a minimum in the flow curve, and all the characteristics peculiar to the evolution from solid state to flow, as predicted by the theory. Despite the short time scale of transition phenomena for the materials tested, the general comparison of experimental results with theory showed good agreement. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Owing to the complex processes involved, faithful prediction of high-velocity impact events demands a simulation method delivering efficient calculations based on comprehensively formulated constitutive models. Such an approach is presented herein, employing a weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) method within an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework for the numerical solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations. Applied widely in computational fluid dynamics, these methods are well suited to the involved locally non-smooth finite deformations, circumventing any requirement for artificial viscosity functions for shock capturing. Application of the methods is facilitated through using a model of solid dynamics based upon hyper-elastic theory comprising kinematic evolution equations for the elastic distortion tensor. The model for finite inelastic deformations is phenomenologically equivalent to Maxwell's model of tangential stress relaxation. Closure relations tailored to the expected high-pressure states are proposed and calibrated for the materials of interest. Sharp interface resolution is achieved by employing level-set functions to track boundary motion, along with a ghost material method to capture the necessary internal boundary conditions for material interactions and stress-free surfaces. The approach is demonstrated for the simulation of high velocity impacts of steel projectiles on aluminium target plates in two and three dimensions.},

abstract = {Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a relatively new meshless numerical approach which has attracted significant attention in the last two decades. Compared with the conventional mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, the SPH approach exhibits some unique advantages in modeling multiphysic flows and associated transport phenomena due to its capabilities of handling complex boundary evolution as well as modeling complicated physics in a relatively simple manner. On the other hand, as SPH is still a developing CFD method, it is crucial to identify its advantages and limitations in modeling realistic multiphysic flow problems of real life and of industrial interest. Toward this end, this work aims at summarizing the motivations behind utilizing the SPH method in an industrial context, making the state-of-the-art of the present application of this method to industrial problems, as well as deriving general conclusions regarding its assets and limitations and stressing the remaining challenges in order to make it an hand-on computational tool.},

abstract = {The description of localisation and structural failure through local damage constitutive laws leads to ill-posed problems. To retrieve a well-posed problem, the material state is described through the gradients of damage in addition to the strain and the damage. Under some assumptions, it is shown that these gradient laws can be cast into a variational formulation. Its numerical treatment is reduced to the design of a mixed finite element so that algorithms such as Newton's method and path-following techniques are still available. Possible convergence difficulties related to the reduction of the damage band width and the appearance of micro instabilities are removed thanks to the design of a new class of brittle laws. Finally, numerical applications show the convergence with mesh refinement, the compatibility with coarser approaches such as Griffith's theory and cohesive crack models, the robustness in case of unstable multi-cracking, the applicability to full-scale 3D situations and the physical relevance compared to experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The behavior of metals at high strain rates (103-10s sec-i and above) is currently attracting increas-ing attention. A limited amount of information on the viscosity of metals under these conditions has been published. Thus, in the early work of A. A. II'yushin [1, 2] and S. M. Popov [3] a metal under high-velocity loading was regarded as a viscoplastic body, for which the relation between the stress a and the strain rate E is given by the relation = ayq-{\~{}}, where ay is the yield stress of the metal; {\#} is the viscosity coefficient. Experiments [1-3] on cylindrical specimens tested in a pneumatic impact tester have indicated that the viscosity coefficients of various steels lie on the interval from 3 9 105 to 14 9 105 p, the corresponding interval for aluminum extending from 3 9 105 to 4 9 103 p. Another method of determining the viscosity of continuous media, based on the experimental inves-tigation of the development of small perturbation s in a shock front, was proposed in [4]. The values of the viscosity coefficients determined by this method [4-6] for various materials (lead, copper, aluminum, steel, mercury, water, etc.) using the same explosive charge are approximately the same and of the order of 104 p. The fact that their values for the viscosity coefficient of aluminum are an order less than those de-termined in [1, 2] is attributed by the authors of [5] to the es;sentiaUy different temperatures in the experi-ments compared.},

abstract = {We utilize nonequilibrium covariant transport theory to determine the region of validity of causal Israel-Stewart (IS) dissipative hydrodynamics and Navier-Stokes (NS) theory for relativistic heavy ion physics applications. A massless ideal gas with 2 → 2 interactions is considered in a Bjorken scenario in 0 + 1 dimension (D) appropriate for the early longitudinal expansion stage of the collision. In the scale-invariant case of a constant shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta$/s ≈ const, we find that IS theory is accurate within 10{\%} in calculating dissipative effects if initially the expansion time scale exceeds half the transport mean free path $\tau$ 0 /$\lambda$ tr,0 {\textgreater} ∼ 2. The same accuracy with NS requires three times larger $\tau$ 0 /$\lambda$ tr,0 {\textgreater} ∼ 6. For dynamics driven by a constant cross section, on the other hand, about 50{\%} larger $\tau$ 0 /$\lambda$ tr,0 {\textgreater} ∼ 3 (IS) and 9 (NS) are needed. For typical applications at energies currently available at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), i.e., √ s NN ∼ 100–200 GeV, these limits imply that even the IS approach becomes marginal when $\eta$/s {\textgreater} ∼ 0.15. In addition, we find that the " naive " approximation to IS theory, which neglects products of gradients and dissipative quantities, has an even smaller range of applicability than Navier-Stokes. We also obtain analytic IS and NS solutions in 0 + 1D, and present further tests for numerical dissipative hydrodynamics codes in 1 + 1, 2 + 1, and 3 + 1D based on generalized conservation laws.},

abstract = {The grand challenges of contemporary fundamental physics---dark matter, dark energy, vacuum energy, inflation and early universe cosmology, singularities and the hierarchy problem---all involve gravity as a key component. And of all gravitational phenomena, black holes stand out in their elegant simplicity, while harbouring some of the most remarkable predictions of General Relativity: event horizons, singularities and ergoregions. The hitherto invisible landscape of the gravitational Universe is being unveiled before our eyes: the historical direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration marks the dawn of a new era of scientific exploration. Gravitational-wave astronomy will allow us to test models of black hole formation, growth and evolution, as well as models of gravitational-wave generation and propagation. It will provide evidence for event horizons and ergoregions, test the theory of General Relativity itself, and may reveal the existence of new fundamental fields. The synthesis of these results has the potential to radically reshape our understanding of the cosmos and of the laws of Nature. The purpose of this work is to present a concise, yet comprehensive overview of the state of the art in the relevant fields of research, summarize important open problems, and lay out a roadmap for future progress.},

abstract = {Multiphase flows occurring in nature and in technological applications are often turbulent. The large range of length scales and timescales in turbulent multiphase flows makes direct numerical simulation of the microscale governing equations intractable for many applications. In this article we review a systematic approach for developing large-eddy-simulation (LES) tools for dispersed multiphase flows starting from the microscale model. A key intermediate step is the mesoscopic model for the dispersed phase, formulated in terms of kinetic equations, that contains the physical models for the flow. Owing to the phase-space variables, direct solution of the mesoscopic model is usually intractable, and additional mathematical approximations are introduced to arrive at a macroscopic model. We show that self-conditioned LES models can be derived for both the mesoscopic and macroscopic models, but the former is preferred to ensure consistency and physical accuracy. The principal difficulties and open challenges ...},

abstract = {This paper is dedicated to establishing a thermodynamically compatible Eulerian theoretical framework for elastoplastic anisotropically damaging materials, that is applicable to high strain rate and strongly compressible problems. The proposed model comprises a system of thermodynamically compatible balance laws based upon hyperelastic-inelastic theory: the mechanical conservation laws are supplemented by kinematic evolution equations for material deformation gradients, which can be written in conservative form. The formulation is rotationally invariant and hyperbolic, with a determinable characteristic structure. An operator split approach is proposed for integrating the governing constitutive models for three-dimensional Cauchy problems, in conjunction with a ghost material numerical method to resolve internal Dirichlet boundaries. Such methods naturally allow the generation of new internal boundaries making them ideal for simulating fragmenting materials and macroscale fracture. A remarkable feature of the proposed approach is that the overall complexity compares favourably with that of the model for elastoplastic deformations only. The simulation of expanding ring and flyer plate experiments are chosen to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Machine learning (ML) offers a wealth of techniques to extract information from data that can be translated into knowledge about the underlying fluid mechanics. Moreover, ML algorithms can augment domain knowledge and automate tasks related to flow control and optimization. This article presents an overview of past history, current developments, and emerging opportunities of ML for fluid mechanics. We outline fundamental ML methodologies and discuss their uses for understanding, modeling, optimizing, and controlling fluid flows. The strengths and limitations of these methods are addressed from the perspective of scientific inquiry that considers data as an inherent part of modeling, experiments, and simulations. ML provides a powerful information-processing framework that can augment, and possibly even transform, current lines of fluid mechanics research and industrial applications.},

We propose a method called Dynamic MaxEnt (DynMaxEnt) that provides a passage from the more detailed evolution equations to equations for the less detailed state variables. The method is based on explicit recognition of the state and conjugate variables, which can relax towards the respective quasi-equilibria in different ways. Detailed state variables are reduced using the usual principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt), whereas relaxation of conjugate variables guarantees that the reduced equations are closed. Moreover, an infinite chain of consecutive DynMaxEnt approximations can be constructed.

We first present a family of conformal theories which are quadratic in the torsion tensor and are constructed out of the tetrad field and of a scalar field. For a particular value of a coupling constant, and in the gauge where the scalar field is restricted to assume a constant value, the theory reduces to the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity, and the tetrad field satisfies Einstein's equations. A second family of theories is formulated out of the tetrad field only, and the theories are not equivalent to the usual Weyl Lagrangian. Therefore, the latter is not the unique genuinely geometrical construction that yields a conformally invariant action. The teleparallel framework allows more possibilities for conformal theories of gravity. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {An analytical model has been developed to describe the diffusion-viscous stress coupling in the liquid phase during rapid solidification of binary mixtures. The model starts with a set of evolution equations for diffusion flux and viscous pressure tensor, based on extended irreversible thermodynamics. It has been demonstrated that the diffusion-stress coupling leads to non-Fickian diffusion effects in the liquid phase. With only diffusive dynamics, the model results in the nonlocal diffusion equations of parabolic type, which imply the transition to complete solute trapping only asymptotically at an infinite interface velocity. With the wavelike dynamics, the model leads to the nonlocal diffusion equations of hyperbolic type and describes the transition to complete solute trapping and diffusionless solidification at a finite interface velocity in accordance with experimental data and molecular dynamic simulation. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Recent progress in the application of Laser Beam Melting (LBM) of oxide ceramics has shown promising results. However, a deeper understanding of the process is required to master and control the track development. In this approach numerical modeling could allow higher quality, of additive manufacturing for such materials, to be achieved. The validation of an earlier developed finite element model for LBM of ceramic materials has been established through a comparison with experimental results. The model solves heat and mass transfers whilst accounting for fluid flow due to surface tension and Marangoni convection, as well as tracking the material/gas boundary. The volumetric heat source parameters used in the simulations have been calibrated with an analytical model combined with original in-situ reflectance measurements. Numerical results show good agreement with measurements of melt pool dimensions and shapes. They also provide a coherent description of the evolution of the track morphology when varying the heat source parameters. Track irregularities have also been revealed by simulations at high scanning speed and the balling effect highlighted and explained through similar simulations.},

abstract = {We apply an accurate numerical scheme to solve for Stokes flow directly on binarized three-dimensional rock images, such as those obtained by micro-CT imaging. The method imposes no-flow conditions exactly at the solid boundaries and employs an algebraic multigrid method to solve for the resultant set of linear equations. We compute the permeability of a range of consolidated and unconsolidated porous rocks; the results are comparable with those obtained using the lattice Boltzmann method and agree with experimental measurements on larger core samples. We show that the Kozeny-Carman equation can over-estimate permeability by a factor of 10 or more, particularly for the more heterogeneous systems studied. We study the existence and size of the representative elementary volume (REV) at lamina scale. We demonstrate that the REV for permeability is larger than for static properties-porosity and specific surface area-since it needs to account for the tortuosity and connectedness of the flow paths. For the carbonate samples, the REV appeared to be larger than the image size. We also study the anisotropy of permeability at the pore scale. We show that the permeability of sandpacks varies by less than 10 {\%} in different directions. For sandstones, permeability changes by 25 {\%} on average. However, the anisotropy of permeability in carbonates can be up to 50 {\%}, indicating the existence of connected pores in one direction which are not connected in another.},

From the point of view of the gauge principle of Weyl and Yang-Mills-Utiyama, it became manifest around the 1960s (Sciama--Kibble) that gravity is closely related to the Poincare group acting in Minkowski space. The gauging of this external group induces a Riemann-Cartan geometry on spacetime. If one generalizes the gauge group of gravity, one finds still more involved spacetime geometries. If one specializes it to the translation group, one finds a specific Riemann-Cartan geometry with teleparallelism (Weitzenbock geometry).},

We introduce a modification of higher order Godunov methods that possesses the correct asymptotic behavior, allowing the use of coarse grids (large cell Peclet numbers). The idea is to build into the numerical scheme the asymptotic balances that lead to this behavior. Numerical experiments on 2 × 2 systems verify our analysis.},

abstract = {The ambiguity of the Weitzenb$\backslash$"{\{}o{\}}ck connection and the meaning of torsion in teleparallel theories are investigated. A new postulate is added to teleparallel theories in order to remove the ambiguity and the inconsistencies in the calculation of the gravitational energy-momentum tensor and the like. In addition to the known restrictions on the spatial triad, it is shown that some restrictions on the congruence used to build the frame must also be imposed. Nevertheless, no restriction is imposed on a particular observer's worldline. The postulate and the restriction presented in this article are used to define what will be called here an ideal frame. This definition is applied to the Schwarzschild and the {\$}pp{\$}-wave spacetimes in the context of the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. In both cases, the results are very appealing and consistent; this includes the impossibility of making the gravitational energy density vanish along the accelerated observers' worldlines used here. Two promising interpretations for the Weitzenb$\backslash$"{\{}o{\}}ck torsion are presented and discussed in detail. The possibility of having a well defined concept of an absolute vacuum in teleparallel theories is also discussed. Finally, some possible solutions to well-known problems of the {\$}f(T){\$} theories are proposed.},

abstract = {We discuss the problems of quantum theory (QT) complicating its merging with general relativity (GR). QT is treated as a general theory of micro-phenomena - a bunch of models. Quantum mechanics (QM) and quantum field theory (QFT) are the most widely known (but, e.g., Bohmian mechanics is also a part of QT). The basic problems of QM and QFT are considered in interrelation. For QM, we stress its nonrelativistic character and the presence of spooky action at a distance. For QFT, we highlight the old problem of infinities. And this is the main point of the paper: it is meaningless to try to unify QFT so heavily suffering of infinities with GR. We also highlight difficulties of the QFT-treatment of entanglement. We compare the QFT and QM based measurement theories by presenting both theoretical and experimental viewpoints. Then we discuss two basic mathematical constraints of both QM and QFT, namely, the use of real (and, hence, complex) numbers and the Hilbert state space. We briefly present non-Archimedean and non-Hilbertian approaches to QT and their consequences. Finally, we claim that, in spite of the Bell theorem, it is still possible to treat quantum phenomena on the basis of a classical-like causal theory. We present a random field model generating the QM and QFT formalisms. This emergence viewpoint can serve as the basis for unification of novel QT (may be totally different from presently powerful QM and QFT) and general relativity GR.

abstract = {The intriguing choice to treat alternative theories of gravity by means of the Palatini approach, namely elevating the affine connection to the role of independent variable, contains the seed of some interesting (usually under-explored) generalizations of General Relativity, the metric-affine theories of gravity. The peculiar aspect of these theories is to provide a natural way for matter fields to be coupled to the independent connection through the covariant derivative built from the connection itself. Adopting a procedure borrowed from the effective field theory prescriptions, we study the dynamics of metric-affine theories of increasing order, that in the complete version include invariants built from curvature, nonmetricity and torsion. We show that even including terms obtained from nonmetricity and torsion to the second order density Lagrangian, the connection lacks dynamics and acts as an auxiliary field that can be algebraically eliminated, resulting in some extra interactions between metric and matter fields.},

abstract = {Many important industrial processes, such as additive manufacturing, involve rapid mass, flow and heat transport between gas, liquid and solid phases. Various associated challenges, such as the large density ratio between gas and condensed phases, make accurate, robust thermal multi-phase flow simulations of these processes very difficult. In order to address some of the associated challenges, a computational framework for thermal multi-phase flows is developed based on the finite element method (FEM). A unified model for thermal multi-phase flows similar to the models widely used in the manufacturing community is adopted. The combination of the level-set method and residual-based variational multi-scale formulation (RBVMS) is used to solve the governing equations of thermal multi-phase flows. Phase transitions between solid and liquid phases, i.e., melting and solidification, are considered. Interfacial forces, including surface tension and Marangoni stress, are taken into account and handled by a density-scaled continuum surface force model. A robust fully coupled solution strategy is adopted to handle various numerical difficulties associated with thermal multi-phase flow simulations, and implemented by means of a matrix-free technique using Flexible GMRES. The mathematical formulation and its algorithmic implementation are described in detail. Four numerical test cases are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed formulation. The first case is a benchmark example of solidification of aluminum in a graphite mold, the second case is a thermo-capillary droplet migration problem, the third case is a spot laser melting problem, and the fourth case is the melting of metal with an interior gas bubble. The computational results are compared with analytical, experimental and simulation data from other researchers, with good agreement in cases where such data is available.},

abstract = {The continuum equations of fluid mechanics are rederived with the intention of keeping certain mechanical and thermodynamic concepts separate. A new " mechanical " mass density is created to be used in computing inertial quantities, whereas the actual mass density is treated as a thermodynamic variable. A new set of balance laws is proposed, including a mass balance equation with a non-convective flux. The basic principles of irreversible thermodynamics are used to obtain linear con-stitutive equations that are expansions of–not only the usual affinities involving gradients of temperature and velocity–but also the gradient of the chemical potential. Transport coefficients are then chosen based on an elementary diffusion model, which yields simple constitutive laws fea-turing just two transport parameters: one for the longitudinal part of the motion and one for the rotational part. The resulting formulation dif-fers from the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations of fluid motion. In order to highlight key similarities and differences between the two approaches, sev-eral examples in fluid mechanics are treated in part II, including sound propagation, light scattering, steady-state shock waves, thermophoresis, and Poiseuille flow.},

abstract = {The review is devoted to the historical and modern understanding of rheological properties of emulsions in a broad range of concentration. In the limiting case of dilute emulsions, the discussion is based on the analogy and differences in properties of suspensions and emulsions. For concentrated emulsions, the main peculiarities of their rheological behaviour are considered. Different approaches to understand the concentration dependencies of viscosity are presented and compared. The effects of non-Newtonian flow curves and the apparent transition to yielding with increasing concentration of the dispersed phase are discussed. The problem of droplet deformation in shear fields is touched. The highly concentrated emulsions (beyond the limit of closest packing of spherical particles) are treated as visco-plastic media, and the principle features of their rheology (elasticity, yielding, concentration and droplet size dependencies) are considered. A special attention is paid to the problem of shear stability of drops of an internal phase starting from the theory of the single drop behaviour, including approaches for the estimation of drops' stability in concentrated emulsions. Polymer blends are also treated as emulsions, though taking into account their peculiarities due to the coexistence of two interpenetrated phases. Different theoretical models of deformation of polymer drops were discussed bearing in mind the central goal of predictions of the visco-elastic properties of emulsions as functions of the properties of individual components and the interfacial layer. The role of surfactants is discussed from the point of view of stability of emulsions in time and their special influence on the rheology of emulsions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present a stable numerical scheme for modelling multiphase flow in porous media, where the characteristic size of the flow domain is of the order of microns to millimetres. The numerical method is developed for efficient modelling of multiphase flow in porous media with complex interface motion and irregular solid boundaries. The Navier-Stokes equations are discretised using a finite volume approach, while the volume-of-fluid method is used to capture the location of interfaces. Capillary forces are computed using a semi-sharp surface force model, in which the transition area for capillary pressure is effectively limited to one grid block. This new formulation along with two new filtering methods, developed for correcting capillary forces, permits simulations at very low capillary numbers and avoids non-physical velocities. Capillary forces are implemented using a semi-implicit formulation, which allows larger time step sizes at low capillary numbers. We verify the accuracy and stability of the numerical method on several test cases, which indicate the potential of the method to predict multiphase flow processes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In this paper the relaxed micromorphic material model for anisotropic elasticity is used to describe the dynamical behavior of a band-gap metamaterial with tetragonal symmetry. Unlike other continuum models, the relaxed micromorphic model is endowed to capture all the main microscopic and macroscopic characteristics of the targeted metamaterial, namely, stiffness, anisotropy, dispersion and band-gaps. The simple structure of our material model, which simultaneously lives on a micro-, a meso- and a macroscopic scale, requires only the identification of a limited number of frequency-independent and thus truly constitutive parameters, valid for both static and wave-propagation analyses in the plane. The static macro- and micro- parameters are identified by numerical homogenization in static tests on the unit-cell level. The 3 macro-parameters are obtained by imposing periodic boundary conditions thus mimicking the structure at large. The 3 micro-parameters can be uniquely identified from unit-cells, which (i) represent the unit-cells with maximal stiffness and (ii) preserve its tetragonal symmetry. Both conditions (i) and (ii) are built on the inherent rationale of the relaxed micromorphic model. The missing mesoscopic elastic parameters directly follow from a recently developed harmonic-mean type micro-macro homogenization rule, which establishes the general relation between the elasticities in the micromorphic model on its three scales. The remaining inertia parameters for dynamical analyses are calibrated on the dispersion curves of the same metamaterial as obtained by a classical Bloch-Floquet analysis for two wave directions. We demonstrate via polar plots that the obtained material parameters describe very well the response of the structural material for all wave directions in the plane, thus covering the complete panorama of anisotropy of the targeted metamaterial.},

Collocated arrangement of variables is used and the pressure-correction method in conjunction with the SIMPLE scheme is applied. In order to avoid the diffusive effects of low order schemes, the approximation of the convection terms is carried out using the QUICK differencing scheme, which is of third order of accuracy. For modelling viscous non-Newtonian behaviour, the Power-Law, Quemada and the modified Bingham and Casson models are employed. Validation of the code is carried out upon comparison with numerical data available in the literature. Exploiting the lid-driven cavity flow a twofold investigation is carried out regarding the non-Newtonian effects first by using different models and secondly by using the shear-thinning and shear-thickening attributes of the fluid. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A flow model is derived for the numerical simulation of multi-phase flows with phase transition. The model arises from the classical multi-component Euler equations, but is associated to a non-classical thermodynamic closure: each phase is compressible and evolves in its own subvolume, with phases sharing common pressure, velocity and temperature, leading to non-trivial thermodynamic relations for the mixture. Phase transition is made possible through the introduction of Gibbs free energy relaxation terms in the equations. Capillary effects and heat conduction - essential in boiling flows - are introduced as well.The resulting multi-phase flow model is hyperbolic, valid for arbitrary density jumps at interfaces as well as arbitrary flow speeds. Its capabilities are illustrated successively through examples of nozzle induced cavitation, a high-speed evaporating liquid jet, and heated wall induced boiling.},

Such situations fall outside the scope of classical plasticity theory which assumes either infinitesimal strains or plastic-rigid theory for large strains. The present theory modifies the kinematics to include finite elastic and plastic strain components. For situations requiring this generalization, dilatational influences are usually significant including thermomechanical coupling. This is introduced through the consideration of two coupled thermodynamic systems: one comprising thermoelasticity at finite strain and the other the irreversible process of dissipation and absorption of plastic work. The present paper generalizes a previous theory to permit arbitrary deformation histories.},

abstract = {High-dimensional PDEs have been a longstanding computational challenge. We propose to solve high-dimensional PDEs by approximating the solution with a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the differential operator, initial condition, and boundary conditions. Our algorithm is meshfree, which is key since meshes become infeasible in higher dimensions. Instead of forming a mesh, the neural network is trained on batches of randomly sampled time and space points. The algorithm is tested on a class of high-dimensional free boundary PDEs, which we are able to accurately solve in up to 200 dimensions. The algorithm is also tested on a high-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman PDE and Burgers' equation. The deep learning algorithm approximates the general solution to the Burgers' equation for a continuum of different boundary conditions and physical conditions (which can be viewed as a high-dimensional space). We call the algorithm a “Deep Galerkin Method (DGM)” since it is similar in spirit to Galerkin methods, with the solution approximated by a neural network instead of a linear combination of basis functions. In addition, we prove a theorem regarding the approximation power of neural networks for a class of quasilinear parabolic PDEs.},

@article{Svendsen1999,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present an alternative formulation of the principles of Euclidean frame-indifference and indifference with respect to superimposed rigid body motions, i.e., rotations and translations. This is accomplished on the basis of the action of the proper Euclidean group on constitutive relationsinduced by the action of this group on the Euclidean tensors appearing in these relations. The resulting formulation of these concepts can then be used to show that the usual concept of material frame-indifference actually consists of twoindependent concepts, i.e., Euclidean frame-indifference andform-invariance, the latter being generally overlooked as an independent concept. On this basis, one can in addition show that any two of the concepts of Euclidean frame-indifference, form-invariance, and indifference with respect to superimposed rigid body motions, automatically implies the third. As an application of this formulation, we discuss the constitutive relations for a simple (elastic) material and a kinetic gas. In this context, it follows straighforwardly that the latter satisfy Euclidean frame-indifference, as shown by Murdoch [1], but not indifference with respect to superimposed rigid body motion, as shown by M{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}ller [2]. As such, the current formation yields immediately that these are not form-invariant, and so not material frame-indifferent.},

We use segmented 3-D images (one for Fontainebleau, three for Berea, three for a carbonate, and one for a sphere pack) to directly compute the absolute permeability, the electrical resistivity, and elastic moduli. The numerical methods tested include a finite-element solver (elastic moduli and electrical conductivity), two finite-difference solvers (elastic moduli and electrical conductivity), a Fourier-based Lippmann-Schwinger solver (elastic moduli), a lattice-Boltzmann solver (hydraulic permeability), and the explicit-jump method (hydraulic permeability and electrical conductivity). The set-ups for these numerical experiments, including the boundary conditions and the total model size, varied as well. The results thus produced vary from each other. For example, the highest computed permeability value may differ from the lowest one by a factor of 1.5. Nevertheless, all these results fall within the ranges consistent with the relevant laboratory data. Our analysis provides the DRP community with a range of possible outcomes which can be expected depending on the solver and its setup. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Finite-scale equations (FSE) describe the evolution of finite volumes of fluid over time. We discuss the FSE for a one-dimensional compressible fluid, whose every point is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. The FSE contain new momentum and internal energy transport terms. These are similar to terms added in numerical simulation for high-speed flows (e.g. artificial viscosity) and for turbulent flows (e.g. subgrid scale models). These similarities suggest that the FSE may provide new insight as a basis for computational fluid dynamics. Our analysis of the FS continuity equation leads to a physical interpretation of the new transport terms, and indicates the need to carefully distinguish between volume-averaged and mass-averaged velocities in numerical simulation. We make preliminary connections to the other recent work reformulating Navier-Stokes equations.},

abstract = {This paper is devoted to the understanding of flow characteristics of granular lubrication. The regimes of interest are: the kinetic regime in which collisions between particles are essentially binary and the quasi-fluid regime in which the duration of particle-to-particle contact is longer, primarily due to compaction. For this purpose, a quasi-two-dimensional particle dynamic simulation package is developed. The contact parameters between particles are chosen in order to mimic kinetic simulations. These contact laws are also valid in the quasi-fluid regime. The predictions of the particle dynamic simulations are compared to those obtained using the kinetic model. Good agreement between the two approaches is demonstrated. Furthermore, it is shown how the flow transition between the kinetic and the quasi-fluid regime can be determined. The influence of parameters that affect the transition is studied. The magnitude of the area fraction, on the order of about 90 percent of that of a hexagonal closest packing, seems to be the main factor that determines this transition.},

In addition, a method for increasing the accuracy of the scheme by sub-tracting off an embedded steady magnetic field is presented. Each of the pieces of the scheme is described, and the scheme is validated and its accuracy assessed by comparison with exact solutions. Results are presented for two three-dimensional calculations representative of the interaction of the solar wind with a magenetized planet.},

@article{Tavelli2017,
abstract = {We propose a new arbitrary high order accurate semi-implicit space-time discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the solution of the two and three dimensional compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on staggered unstructured curved meshes. The method is pressure-based and semi-implicit and is able to deal with all Mach number flows. The new DG scheme extends the seminal ideas outlined in [1], where a second order semi-implicit finite volume method for the solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a general equation of state was introduced on staggered Cartesian grids. Regarding the high order extension we follow [2], where a staggered space-time DG scheme for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations was presented. In our scheme, the discrete pressure is defined on the primal grid, while the discrete velocity field and the density are defined on a face-based staggered dual grid. Then, the mass conservation equation, as well as the nonlinear convective terms in the momentum equation and the transport of kinetic energy in the energy equation are discretized explicitly, while the pressure terms appearing in the momentum and energy equation are discretized implicitly. Formal substitution of the discrete momentum equation into the total energy conservation equation yields a linear system for only one unknown, namely the scalar pressure. Here the equation of state is assumed linear with respect to the pressure. The enthalpy and the kinetic energy are taken explicitly and are then updated using a simple Picard procedure. Thanks to the use of a staggered grid, the final pressure system is a very sparse block five-point system for three dimensional problems and it is a block four-point system in the two dimensional case. Furthermore, for high order in space and piecewise constant polynomials in time, the system is observed to be symmetric and positive definite. This allows to use fast linear solvers such as the conjugate gradient (CG) method. In addition, all the volume and surface integrals needed by the scheme depend only on the geometry and the polynomial degree of the basis and test functions and can therefore be precomputed and stored in a preprocessing stage. This leads to significant savings in terms of computational effort for the time evolution part. In this way also the extension to a fully curved isoparametric approach becomes natural and affects only the preprocessing step. The viscous terms and the heat flux are also discretized making use of the staggered grid by defining the viscous stress tensor and the heat flux vector on the dual grid, which corresponds to the use of a lifting operator, but on the dual grid. The time step of our new numerical method is limited by a CFL condition based only on the fluid velocity and not on the sound speed. This makes the method particularly interesting for low Mach number flows. Finally, a very simple combination of artificial viscosity and the a posteriori MOOD technique allows to deal with shock waves and thus permits also to simulate high Mach number flows. We show computational results for a large set of two and three-dimensional benchmark problems, including both low and high Mach number flows and using polynomial approximation degrees up to p=4.},

Results are compared for the distribution function, psi, and the orientation tensor, A, playing the role of state variables. The main results are the following: (i) In the thermodynamical analysis the formulas arise as compatibility conditions between the time evolution of the fluid velocity and the time evolution of the internal structure. (ii) A complete agreement among the formulas arising in mechanics and thermodynamics is seen only in kinetic theory (i.e., with psi as the state variable) and only with the Chan-Terentjev mechanical formula. (iii) Theoretical arguments as well as numerical illustrations indicate that the larger is the role of the reversible part of the time evolution of the microstructure, the larger is the difference in predicted stresses (i.e., the formulas for sigma evaluated at solutions of the microstructural equations) calculated with the thermodynamic and the Dinh-Armstrong mechanical formulas.

@article{Smarr1978,
abstract = {We adopt the point of view that a solution of Einstein's equations is an evolution of given initial Cauchy data. Implementing the evolution equations necessarily requires a determination, not directly dictated by the field equations, of the kinematics of the observers in terms of which the evolution is represented. In this paper we study the observers' kinematics (velocities and accelerations) in terms of the geometry of their congruences of world lines relative to families of time slicings of spacetime, which contrasts with the more usual approach of imposing particular "gauge" or "coordinate conditions." The types of conditions we suggest are adapted to the exact Einstein equations for general strong-field, dynamic spacetimes that have to be calculated numerically. Typically, the equations are three-dimensionally covariant, elliptic, and linear in the kinematical functions (the lapse function and shift vector) that they determine. The gravitational field enters in nonlinear form through the presence of curvature in the equations. We present a flat-space model of such elliptic equations (e.g. for maximal slicing) which suggests that this curvature leads to an exponential decrease in the proper time between time slices at late times. We show how the use of maximal slicing with minimal-distortion observers generalizes the notion of a stationary rest frame to dynamical asymptotically flat spacetimes. In cosmological spacetimes the use of minimum-distortion observers is shown to differentiate between those universes which contain only kinematic time dependence (e.g. open Kasner universe) and those in which dynamical degrees of freedom are present (e.g. mixmaster universe). We examine many examples and construct new coordinate systems in both asymptotically flat and cosmological solutions to illustrate these properties.},

The relaxation of the disequilibrium among the three components of the kinetic temperature, namely, the difference between the component in the direction of a planar shock wave and those in the transverse directions, particularly in the region near the shock front, is accomplished at a much more quantitative level by the first-ever rigorous application of the Cattaneo-Maxwell relaxation equation to a reference solution, namely, the steady shockwave solution of linear Navier- Stokes-Fourier theory, along with the nonlinear Burnett heat-flux term. Our new continuum theory is in nearly quantitative agreement with non-equilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations under strong shockwave conditions, using relaxation parameters obtained from the reference solution. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Several technological situations at moderate and high temperatures as well as many physical experiments at low temperatures show the necessity of taking into account the wave structure of heat transport. Motivated by experimental evidence a thermo-mechanical framework for a deformable heat-conducting continuum has been developed. In this framework, a history effect is present, it is introduced via a proportionality law between the heat flux vector and the gradient of a scalar thermal variable. The theory leads to a modified model of thermoelasticity with an extra thermal stress effect and wave-type heat conduction. The model is governed by a system of quasi-linear hyperbolic equations. All essential material functions are examined, and the impact of their nonlinearity on the solution to initial-boundary value problems is studied. A numerical scheme is developed to solve initial-boundary value problems on finite domains by a modification of Lax-Wendroff's scheme. It turns out that the previously studied case of NaF crystals considered as rigid heat conductors was quantitatively quite acceptable: while it does not show any elastic waves, it still gives correct speeds and amplitudes of the pure thermal waves. However, this feature of upward compatibility of theories is lost for materials with higher thermal expansion coefficients. Hence, for new applications, it is of the essence to develop numerical methods for the fully coupled theory in 2D and 3D cases. {\textcopyright} 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {A class of dynamic models to describe finite anisotropic elasto-viscoplastic behavior in an Eulerian setting are examined from the perspective of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. A proper description of anisotropic elastic behavior, using the deformation gradient as an internal variable, serves as a starting point. A general model for elasto-viscoplastic deformation is then formulated by allowing isochoric relaxation of the total deformation gradient, giving rise to an elastic deformation gradient and a plastic strain rate. Thermodynamic restrictions on specific forms of the plastic strain rate for anisotropic materials, using the representation theorem for tensor functions, are discussed. In addition, the thermodynamic admissibility of a multi-mode formulation of the elasto-viscoplastic model is demonstrated. Finally, the model is applied to describe rate-dependent inelastic deformation of an amorphous polymer glass, and anisotropic strain-rate dependent crystalline slip as found in metal plasticity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A Lagrangian for the coupled system of a nematic liquid crystal and the electromagnetic field is constructed, from which a complete set of equations of motion for the system is derived. The canonical energy-momentum and spin tensors are systematically obtained. We compare our results with those within the nonrelativistic models.

abstract = {Granular materials composed of particles with differing grain sizes, densities, shapes, or surface properties may experience unexpected segregation during flow. This review focuses on kinetic sieving and squeeze expulsion, whose combined effect produces the dominant gravity-driven segregation mechanism in dense sheared flows. Shallow granular avalanches that form at the surface of more complex industrial flows such as heaps, silos, and rotating drums provide ideal conditions for particles to separate, with large particles rising to the surface and small particles percolating down to the base. When this is combined with erosion and deposition, amazing patterns can form in the underlying substrate. Gravity-driven segregation and velocity shear induce differential lateral transport, which may be thought of as a secondary segregation mechanism. This allows larger particles to accumulate at flow fronts, and if they are more frictional than the fine grains, they can feedback on the bulk flow, causing flow finge...},

The hyperbolic model is applied at the nanometer scale of the interface width $\delta$. The parabolic model is derived by a coarse-graining procedure and is intended to operate with mesoscopic resolution of the interface $\eta$. The coarse-graining numerical parameters, namely interface width $\eta$ and the interface permeability P, are adjusted in the parabolic model to fit the segregation coefficient calculated by the microscopic model on the nanoscale. Based on the optimal sets of $\eta$ and P selected at small interface velocity, a linear relation between their logarithm values is obtained. This logarithmic relation provides a theoretical basis for choosing the appropriate values of $\eta$ and P in the numerical phase-field simulation in three spatial dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

The solidification front is treated as a moving interface in the diffuse approximation as known from phase-field theories. The no-slip condition between the melt and the solid is realized via a drag resistivity in the diffuse interface region. The model is shown to accurately reproduce the usual sharp interface conditions in the limit of a thin diffuse interface region. A first test of the model is provided for flow through regular arrays of cylinders with a stationary interface. Then, two examples are presented that involve solid/liquid phase-change: (i) coarsening of a mush of a binary alloy, where both the interface curvature and the flow permeability evolve with time, and (ii) dendritic growth in the presence of melt convection with particular emphasis on the operating point of the tip. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Acoustic black holes are relatively new physical objects that have been introduced and investigated mainly during the last decade. They can absorb almost 100{\%} of the incident wave energy, and this makes them very attractive for such traditional engineering applications as vibration damping in different engineering structures and sound absorption in gases and liquids. They also could be useful for some ultrasonic devices using Lamb wave propagation to provide anechoic termination for such waves. So far, acoustic black holes have been investigated mainly for flexural waves in thin plates, for which the required gradual changes in local wave velocity with distance can be easily achieved by changing the plates' local thickness. The present paper provides a brief review of the theory of acoustic black holes, including their comparison with optic black holes introduced about five years ago. Review is also given of the recent experimental work carried out at Loughborough University on damping structural vibrations using the acoustic black hole effect. This is followed by the discussion on potential applications of the acoustic black hole effect for sound absorption in air.},

An introductory section establishes definitions and notation, introduces tetrads, the anholonomic formulation and the Dirac equation in curved space with torsion. After that, gauge theories of gravitation are introduced, starting with local Poincar{\'{e}} gauge theory, in which the torsion arises as a translational gauge field strength, and other gauge approaches are described. Torsion that is derived from a potential, including a scalar, vector, and tensor potential is discussed, with emphasis on the antisymmetric tensor of the string theory kind. Teleparallel theories are described, conformal invariance is discussed and a brief section on the equation of motion is presented. Experiments that have searched for, or bounded, torsion are described and the possible physical manifestations are broken down into the broad areas of quantum effects, laboratory scale phenomena and large-scale tests. Finally, a discussion of the relationship between string theory and torsion is presented.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comparative study of the gradient-enhanced damage models (GED) of Peerlings et al. (1996), Vandoren and Simone (2018) and the phase field damage/fracture model (PFM) of Wu (2017), Wu and Nguyen (2018) within the context of the computational modeling of the fracture of quasi-brittle materials (concrete, ceramic, rock, ice, etc.). Being continuous damage/fracture models, these two models enjoy the simplicity of modeling the fracture process on a fixed finite element mesh. The similarities and differences of the two models are discussed by examining governing equations and conducting numerical simulations of some mode I and mixed-mode fracture benchmark tests. The most worthy findings are: (i) both classes of models can handle the initiation and propagation of cohesive cracks, (ii) they are totally different–PFM behaves like a cohesive zone model (a sub-class of fracture mechanics) when the length scale is sufficiently small and the response is insensitive to this length scale whereas GED is a non-local damage model (a sub-class of continuum damage mechanics) of which response obviously depends on the length scale.},

abstract = {Strain gradient models and generalized continua are increasingly used to introduce characteristic lengths in the mechanical behavior of materials with microstructure. On the other hand, phase-field models have proved to be efficient tools to simulate microstructure evolution due to thermodynamical processes in the presence of mechanical deformation. It is shown that both methods have strong connections from the point of view of thermomechanical field theory. A general formulation of thermomechanics with additional degrees of freedom is presented that encompasses both applications as special cases. It is based on the introduction of additional power of internal forces introducing generalized stresses. The current knowledge in the formulation of physically non-linear constitutive equations is used to develop strongly coupled elastoviscoplastic material models involving phase transformation and moving boundaries. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {We have carried out a hydrodynamical code comparison study of interacting multiphase fluids. The two commonly used techniques of grid and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) show striking differences in their ability to model processes that are fundamentally important across many areas of astrophysics. Whilst Eulerian grid based methods are able to resolve and treat important dynamical instabilities, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz or Rayleigh-Taylor, these processes are poorly or not at all resolved by existing SPH techniques. We show that the reason for this is that SPH, at least in its standard implementation, introduces spurious pressure forces on particles in regions where there are steep density gradients. This results in a boundary gap of the size of the SPH smoothing kernel over which information is not transferred.},

abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of the unconstrained variational formulation of the relativistic elasticity theory together with a discussion of (virtually) all other variational formulations of the theories. It also reviews the extension of the unconstrained formulation to the case of non-dissipative thermo-elastic materials for extension to discontinuous materials. As existing, equivalent variational formulations of relativistic elasticity theory emphasize on formulation based on the parameterization of material configurations. In this description, elasticity can be treated as a gauge type theory, where the role of gauge transformations is played by diffeomorphisms of the material space. It is shown that the dynamics of the theory can be formulated in terms of three independent, hyperbolic, second-order partial differential equations imposed on three independent gauge potentials. Canonical (unconstrained) momenta conjugate to the three configuration variables and the Hamiltonian of the system can be easily found. The extension of the theory to non-dissipative thermo-elasticity and the applications of the theory in astrophysics and quantum gravity are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Here, through in situ and operando high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging, we reveal the underlying physical phenomena during the deposition of the first and second layer melt tracks. We show that the laser-induced gas/vapour jet promotes the formation of melt tracks and denuded zones via spattering (at a velocity of 1 m s−1). We also uncover mechanisms of pore migration by Marangoni-driven flow (recirculating at a velocity of 0.4 m s−1), pore dissolution and dispersion by laser re-melting. We develop a mechanism map for predicting the evolution of melt features, changes in melt track morphology from a continuous hemi-cylindrical track to disconnected beads with decreasing linear energy density and improved molten pool wetting with increasing laser power. Our results clarify aspects of the physics behind LAM, which are critical for its development.},

This is rather surprising, because floating-point is ubiquitous in computer systems: Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support floating point.},

abstract = {In this paper, the shear and extensional rheology of fumed silica nanoparticles dispersed in an aqueous polyethylene oxide (PEO) solution is investigated. The role of particle concentration, polymer concentration, and polymer molecular weight on both the shear and the elongational behavior of the dispersions was examined. The fumed silica dispersions were found to strongly shear thicken. Increasing particle concentration was found to increase the degree of shear thickening. The effect of polymer concentration and polymer molecular weight on shear-thickening behavior was found to be nonmonotonic. The data showed a maximum in shear thickening at an optimum polymer concentration and molecular weight. Increasing the polymer concentration and molecular weight was found to reduce the critical shear rate for the onset of shear thickening. Linear viscoelastic measurements showed a qualitatively similar trend in the elastic modulus. Extensional rheology was conducted using a capillary breakup extensional rheometer. The dispersions showed strong strain-hardening behavior with thickening magnitudes similar to that observed under shear. The trends in the magnitude of extensional hardening with particle and polymer concentration were found to be similar to shear. In some cases, extensional thickening of nearly 1000 times was observed. However, in contrast to shear, increasing the molecular weight of the PEO corresponded to a sharp increase in extensional strain-hardening likely due to the role of polymer-induced elasticity which was shown to cause extensional hardening even in the absence of nanoparticles.},

abstract = {[1] We study and explain the origin of early breakthrough and long tailing plume behavior by simulating solute transport through 3-D X-ray images of six different carbonate rock samples, representing geological media with a high degree of pore-scale complexity. A Stokes solver is employed to compute the flow field, and the particles are then transported along streamlines to represent advection, while the random walk method is used to model diffusion. We compute the propagators (concentration versus displacement) for a range of Peclet numbers (Pe) and relate it to the velocity distribution obtained directly on the images. There is a very wide distribution of velocity that quantifies the impact of pore structure on transport. In samples with a relatively narrow spread of velocities, transport is characterized by a small immobile concentration peak, representing essentially stagnant portions of the pore space, and a dominant secondary peak of mobile solute moving at approximately the average flow speed. On the other hand, in carbonates with a wider velocity distribution, there is a significant immobile peak concentration and an elongated tail of moving fluid. An increase in Pe, decreasing the relative impact of diffusion, leads to the faster formation of secondary mobile peak(s). This behavior indicates highly anomalous transport. The implications for modeling field-scale transport are discussed. Citation: Bijeljic, B., P. Mostaghimi, and M. J.

We use exterior calculus to formulate incompressible hydrodynamic equations in the Stokesian regime and handle the divergence-free constraints via a generalized vector potential. This provides less coordinate-centric descriptions and enables the development of efficient numerical methods and a splitting scheme of the fourth-order governing equations in terms of two second-order elliptic operators. We show our methods have high-order convergence rates for the metric and other geometric quantities of the manifold, for the truncation errors of exterior calculus operators, and for the solution errors of the Stokes problem for hydrodynamic flows on curved surfaces. Our approaches also may be utilized to develop high-order solvers for other scalar-valued and vector-valued problems on manifolds.},

abstract = {Teleparallel theories of gravity have a long history. They include a special case referred to as the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR, also known as GR{\^{a}}̂¥). Recently this theory has been generalized to f(T) gravity. Tight constraints from observations suggest that f(T) gravity is not as robust as initially hoped. This might hint at hitherto undiscovered problems at the theoretical level. In this work, we point out that a generic f(T) theory can be expected to have certain problems including superluminal propagating modes, the presence of which can be revealed by using the characteristic equations that govern the dynamics in f(T) gravity and/or the Hamiltonian structure of the theory via Dirac constraint analysis. We use several examples from simpler gauge field theories to explain how such superluminal modes could arise. We also point out problems with the Cauchy development of a constant time hypersurface in Friedmann-Lema{\^{i}}tre- Roberson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime in f(T) gravity. The time evolution from a FLRW (and as a special case, Minkowski spacetime) initial condition is not unique. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

@article{Gaume2011,
abstract = {On the basis of discrete element numerical simulations of a Couette cell, we revisit the rheology of granular materials in the quasistatic and inertial regimes, and discuss the origin of the transition between these two regimes. We show that quasistatic zones are the seat of a creep process whose rate is directly related to the existence and magnitude of velocity fluctuations. The mechanical behavior in the quasistatic regime is characterized by a three-variable constitutive law relating the friction coefficient (normalized stress), the inertial number (normalized shear rate), and the normalized velocity fluctuations. Importantly, this constitutive law appears to remain also valid in the inertial regime, where it can account for the one-to-one relationship observed between the friction coefficient and the inertial number. The abrupt transition between the quasistatic and inertial regimes is then related to the mode of production of the fluctuations within the material, from nonlocal and artificially sustained by the boundary conditions in the quasistatic regime, to purely local and self-sustained in the inertial regime. This quasistatic-to-inertial transition occurs at a critical inertial number or, equivalently, at a critical level of fluctuations.},

These competing factors require the development of state-of-the-art algorithms that can optimally exploit the targeted underlying hardware and efficiently deliver the extreme computational capabilities typically required in operational forecast production. These algorithms should (i) minimise the energy footprint along with the time required to produce a solution, (ii) maintain a satisfying level of accuracy, (iii) be numerically stable and resilient, in case of hardware or software failure.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is leading a project called ESCAPE (Energy-efficient SCalable Algorithms for weather Prediction on Exascale supercomputers) which is funded by Horizon 2020 (H2020) under initiative Future and Emerging Technologies in High Performance Computing (FET-HPC). The goal of the ESCAPE project is to develop a sustainable strategy to evolve weather and climate prediction models to next-generation computing technologies. The project partners incorporate the expertise of leading European regional forecasting consortia, university research, experienced high-performance computing centres and hardware vendors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper presents an overview of results obtained in the ESCAPE project in which weather prediction have been broken down into smaller building blocks called dwarfs.

The dwarfs are analysed and optimised in terms of computing performance for different hardware architectures (mainly Intel Skylake CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, Intel Xeon Phi). The ESCAPE project includes the development of new algorithms that are specifically designed for better energy efficiency and improved portability through domain specific languages. In addition, the modularity of the algorithmic framework, naturally allows testing different existing numerical approaches, and their interplay with the emerging heterogeneous hardware landscape. Throughout the paper, we will compare different numerical techniques to solve the main building blocks that constitute weather models, in terms of energy efficiency and performance, on a variety of computing technologies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The thermomechanical analysis of powder-bed fusion using a laser beam is simulated in both meso- and macroscales within a framework combining continuum assumption and level-set formulation. The mesoscale simulation focuses on laser interaction with the powder bed, and on subsequent melting and solidification. Modelling is conducted at the scale of material deposition, in which powder-bed fusion, hydrodynamics in the melt pool, and thermal stress are simulated. The macroscale model focuses on part construction and post-deposition. During construction, by contrast with the mesoscale approach, the fluid flow in the fusion zone is ignored and material addition is simplified by modelling it at the scale of entire layers, or fractions of layers. The modelling of the energy input is adapted accordingly. This thermomechanical model addresses heat exchange, residual stress, and distortion at the part's scale. In both approaches, adaptive remeshing is applied, providing a good compromise between the needs to provide accurate prediction and maintaining sustainable computation times.},

There is no general nonequilibrium thermodynamic formulation of entropy; the extension of equilibrium theory to nonequililbrium processes is usually made through the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). However, gas kinetic theory provides a perfectly general formulation of a nonequilibrium entropy in terms of the probability distribution function (PDF) solutions of the Boltzmann equation. In this paper I will evaluate the Boltzmann entropy for the PDF that underlies the Navier–Stokes equations and also for the PDF of the Mott–Smith shock solution. I will show that both monotonically increase in the shock. I will propose a new nonequilibrium thermodynamic entropy and show that it is also monotone and closely approximates the Boltzmann entropy.},

abstract = {Most numerical schemes applied to solve the advection-diffusion equation are affected by numerical diffusion. Moreover, unphysical results, such as oscillations and negative concentrations, may emerge when an anisotropic dispersion tensor is used, which induces even more severe errors in the solution of multispecies reactive transport. To cope with this long standing problem we propose a modified version of the standard Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method based on a Moving-Least-Squares-Weighted-Essentially-Non-Oscillatory (MLS-WENO) reconstruction of concentrations. This scheme formulation (called MWSPH) approximates the diffusive fluxes with a Rusanov-type Riemann solver based on high order WENO scheme. We compare the standard SPH with the MWSPH for different a few test cases, considering both homogeneous and heterogeneous flow fields and different anisotropic ratios of the dispersion tensor. We show that, MWSPH is stable and accurate and that it reduces the occurrence of negative concentrations compared to standard SPH. When negative concentrations are observed, their absolute values are several orders of magnitude smaller compared to standard SPH. In addition, MWSPH limits spurious oscillations in the numerical solution more effectively than classical SPH. Convergence analysis shows that MWSPH is computationally more demanding than SPH, but with the payoff a more accurate solution, which in addition is less sensitive to particles position. The latter property simplifies the time consuming and often user dependent procedure to define the initial dislocation of the particles.},

abstract = {A new reconstructed Discontinuous Galerkin (rDG) method, based on orthogonal basis/test functions, is developed for fluid flows on unstructured meshes. Orthogonality of basis functions is essential for enabling robust and efficient fully-implicit Newton-Krylov based time integration. The method is designed for generic partial differential equations, including transient, hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptic operators, which are attributed to many multiphysics problems. We demonstrate the method's capabilities for solving compressible fluid-solid systems (in the low Mach number limit), with phase change (melting/solidification), as motivated by applications in Additive Manufacturing (AM). We focus on the method's accuracy (in both space and time), as well as robustness and solvability of the system of linear equations involved in the linearization steps of Newton-based methods. The performance of the developed method is investigated for highly-stiff problems with melting/solidification, emphasizing the advantages from tight coupling of mass, momentum and energy conservation equations, as well as orthogonality of basis functions, which leads to better conditioning of the underlying (approximate) Jacobian matrices, and rapid convergence of the Krylov-based linear solver.},

abstract = {This review presents the state of the art of hybrid RANS/LES modeling for the simulation of turbulent flows. After recalling the modeling used in RANS and LES method- ologies, we propose in a first step a theoretical formalism developed in the spectral space that allows to unify the RANS and LES methods from a physical standpoint. In a second step, we discuss the principle of the hybrid RANS/LES methods capable of representing a RANS-type behavior in the vicinity of a solid boundary and an LES-type behavior far away from the wall boundary. Then, we analyze the principal hybrid RANS/LES methods usually used to perform numerical simulation of turbulent flows encountered in engineering appli- cations. In particular, we investigate the very large eddy simulation (VLES), the detached eddy simulation (DES), the partially integrated transport modeling (PITM) method, the partially averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) method, and the scale adaptive simulation (SAS) from a physical point of view. Finally, we establish the connection between these meth- ods and more precisely, the link between PITM and PANS as well as DES and PITM showing that these methods that have been built by different ways, practical or theoreti- cal manners have common points of comparison. It is the opinion of the author to consider that the most appropriate method for a particular application will depend on the expecta- tions of the engineer and the computational resources the user is prepared to expend on the problem.},

abstract = {A higher-order Godunov method is presented for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with stiff, relaxing source terms. The goal is to develop a Godunov method that produces higher-order accurate solutions using time and space increments governed solely by the nonstiff part of the system, i.e., without fully resolving the effect ofthe stiff source terms. It is assumed that the system satisfies a certain "subcharacteristic" condition. The method is a semi-implicit form of a method developed by Colella for hyperbolic conservation laws with nonstiff source terms. In addition to being semi-implicit, our method differs from the method for nonstiff systems in its treatment of the characteristic form of the equations. The method is applied to a model system of equations and to a system of equations for gas flow with heat transfer. Our analytical and numerical results show that the modifications to the nonstiffmethod are necessary for obtaining second-order accuracy as the relaxation time tends to zero. Our numerical results also suggest that certain modifications to the Riemann solver used by the Godunov method would help reduce numerical oscillations produced by the scheme near discontinuities. The development of a modified Riemann solver is a topic of future work. Key},

abstract = {Laser welding of metals involves with formation of a melt-pool and subsequent rapid solidification, resulting in alteration of properties and the microstructure of the welded metal. Understanding and predicting relationships between laser welding process parameters, such as laser speed and welding power, and melt-pool characteristics have been the subjects of many studies in literature because this knowledge is critical to controlling and improving laser welding. Recent advances in metal additive manufacturing processes have renewed interest in the melt-pool studies because in many of these processes, part fabrication involves small moving melt-pools. The present work is a critical review of the literature on experimental and modeling studies on laser welding, with the focus being on the influence of process parameters on geometry, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, microstructure, and porosity characteristics of the melt-pool. These data may inform future experimental laser welding studies and may be used for verification and validation of results obtained in future melt-pool modeling studies.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of filtration through porous media is relevant in many engineering applications ranging from waste water treatment and aquifer contamination in environmental engineering to estimating the permeability reduction in near wellbore region during drilling or water re-injection in petroleum engineering. In this paper we present a pore-scale approach that models straining through the pore structures extracted from X-ray tomographic images of rock and grain pack samples from the first principles, enabling the examination of current macroscopic models. While continuum models are widely used for fast prediction of the retention profiles and permeability of the host porous medium, they require a number of phenomenological parameters which are derived from matching experimental results. One of these parameters is the rate of entrapment, which is the sink term in the advection-diffusion equation. Here we find the constitutive relationship for the rate of entrapment as a product of the filtration coefficient, velocity, and concentration and validate it by comparing with core flood experiments. Results show that the pore-scale simulation gives close approximations of filtration coefficient when pore bridging and straining are the main particle capture mechanisms.},

We then discuss the successes and limitations of this empirical rheology in light of recent alternative theoretical approaches. Finally, we briefly present depth-averaged methods developed for free surface granular flows.},

@article{Frewer2016,
abstract = {Form-invariance (covariance) and frame-indifference (objectivity) are two notions in classical continuum mechanics which have attracted much attention and controversy over the past decades. Particularly in turbulence modelling it seems that there still is a need for clarification. The aim and purpose of this study is fourfold: (i) To achieve consensus in general on definitions and principles when trying to establish an invariant theory for modelling constitutive structures and dynamic processes in mechanics, where special focus is put on the principle of Material Frame-Indifference (MFI). (ii) To show that in constitutive modelling MFI can only be regarded as an approximation that needs to be reduced to a weaker statement when trying to advance it to an axiom of nature. (iii) To convince that in dynamical modelling, as in turbulence, MFI may not be utilized as a modelling guideline, not even in an approximative sense. Instead, its reduced form has to be supplemented by a second, independent axiom that includes the microscopic (fluctuating) description of the dynamical processes. Concerning Navier-Stokes turbulence, the axiom of Turbulent Frame-Indifference (TFI) is stated in which turbulence has to be modelled consistently with the invariant properties of the deterministic Navier-Stokes equations, and finally (iv) to propose a novel invariant modelling ansatz both for constitutive and dynamical modelling that allows to include the (mean) velocity field as an own independent modelling variable, however, not in an absolute but only in the relative sense as a velocity difference; a result that would systematically improve current modelling procedures in extended thermodynamics and turbulence theory to be more consistent with physical observations.},

abstract = {Brain activity takes place in three spatial-plus time dimensions. This rather obvious claim has been recently questioned by papers that, taking into account the big data outburst and novel available computational tools, are starting to unveil a more intricate state of affairs. Indeed, various brain activities and their correlated mental functions can be assessed in terms of trajectories embedded in phase spaces of dimensions higher than the canonical ones. In this review, I show how further dimensions may not just represent a convenient methodological tool that allows a better mathematical treatment of otherwise elusive cortical activities, but may also reflect genuine functional or anatomical relationships among real nervous functions. I then describe how to extract hidden multidimensional information from real or artificial neurodata series, and make clear how our mind dilutes, rather than concentrates as currently believed, inputs coming from the environment. Finally, I argue that the principle “the higher the dimension, the greater the information” may explain the occurrence of mental activities and elucidate the mechanisms of human diseases associated with dimensionality reduction.},

However, the transition of this technology from production of prototypes to production of critical parts is hindered by a lack of confidence in the quality of the part. Confidence can be established via a fundamental understanding of the physics of the process. It is generally accepted that this understanding will be increasingly achieved through modeling and simulation. However, there are significant physics, computational, and materials challenges stemming from the broad range of length and time scales and temperature ranges associated with the process. In this paper, we review the current state of the art and describe the challenges that need to be met to achieve the desired fundamental understanding of the physics of the process.},

abstract = {General relativity has two fundamental problems that render it unsuitable for tackling the gravitational field's quantization. The first problem is the lack of a genuine gravitational variable representing gravitation only, inertial forces apart. The second problem is its incompatibility with quantum mechanics, a problem inherited from the more fundamental conflict of special relativity with quantum mechanics. A procedure to overcome these difficulties is outlined, which amounts to replacing general relativity with its teleparallel equivalent and the Poincar$\backslash$'e-invariant special relativity with the de Sitter-invariant special relativity. Those replacements give rise to the de Sitter-modified teleparallel gravity, which does not have the two mentioned problems. It can thus be considered an improved alternative approach to quantum gravity.},

abstract = {Soft materials consist of basic units that are significantly larger than an atom but much smaller than the overall dimensions of the sample. The label " soft condensed matter " emphasizes that the large basic building blocks of these materials produce low elastic moduli that govern a material's ability to withstand deformations. Aside from softness, there are many other properties that are also caused by the large size of the constituent building blocks. Soft matter is dissipative, disordered, far-from-equilibrium, non-linear, thermal and entropic, slow, observable, gravity-affected, patterned, non-local, interfa-cially elastic and active. This is only a partial list of how matter created from large component particles is distinct from " hard matter " composed of constituents at an atomic scale. Issues inherent in soft matter raise problems that are broadly important in diverse areas of science and require multiple modes of attack. For example, far-from-equilibrium be-havior is confronted in biology, chemistry, geophysics, astrophysics and nuclear physics. Similarly, issues dealing with disorder appear broadly throughout many branches of inquiry wherever rugged landscapes are invoked. This article reviews the discussions that occurred during a workshop held on January 30-31, 2016 in which opportunities in soft-matter experiment were surveyed. Soft matter has had an exciting history of discovery and continues to be a fertile ground for future research.},

abstract = {The Smooth-Particle-Hydrodynamics (SPH) method is derived in a novel manner by means of a Galerkin approximation applied to the Lagrangian equations of continuum mechanics as in the finite-element method. This derivation is modified to replace the SPH interpolant with the Moving-Least-Squares (MLS) interpolant of Lancaster and Saulkaskas, and define a new particle volume which ensures thermodynamic compatibility. A variable-rank modification of the MLS interpolants which retains their desirable summa-tion properties is introduced to remove the singularities that occur when divergent flow reduces the number of neighbours of a particle to less than the minimum required. A surprise benefit of the Galerkin SPH derivation is a theoretical justification of a common ad hoc technique for variable-h SPH. The new MLSPH method is conservative if an anti-symmetric quadrature rule for the stiffness matrix elements can be supplied. In this paper, a simple one-point collocation rule is used to retain similarity with SPH, leading to a non-conservative method. Several examples document how MLSPH renders dramatic improvements due to the linear consistency of its gradients on three canonical difficulties of the SPH method: spurious boundary effects, erroneous rates of strain and rotation and tension instability. Two of these examples are non-linear Lagrangian patch tests with analytic solutions with which MLSPH agrees almost exactly. The examples also show that MLSPH is not absolutely stable if the problems are run to very long times. A linear stability analysis explains both why it is more stable than SPH and not yet absolutely stable and an argument is made that for realistic dynamic problems MLSPH is stable enough. The notion of coherent particles, for which the numerical stability is identical to the physical stability, is introduced. The new method is easily retrofitted into a generic SPH code and some observations on performance are made.},

We show that the rheological constitutive relation, characterized by a dynamical friction coefficient of the form {\$}\backslashmu(I)=\backslashmu{\_}c + a I{\^{}}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} is marginally affected by the particle stiffness, with constitutive parameters being essentially dependent on the inter-particle friction. Similarly, the distribution of local shear rate mostly depends on the inertial number {\$}I{\$}, which shows that the characteristic timescale of plastic events is primarily controlled by the confining pressure and is insensitive to {\$}S{\$}. By contrast, the form under which energy is stored between these events, but also the contact network properties such as the coordination number and the distance to isostaticity, are strongly affected by stiffness, allowing us to discuss the different regimes in the {\$}(S,I){\$} phase space.},

abstract = {We present efficient algorithms and implementations of the 35-moment system equipped with the maximum-entropy closure in the context of rarefied gases. While closures based on the principle of entropy maximization have been shown to yield very promising results for moderately rarefied gas flows, the computational cost of these closures is in general much higher than for closure theories with explicit closed-form expressions of the closing fluxes, such as Grad's classical closure. Following a similar approach as Garrett et al. (2015) [13], we investigate efficient implementations of the computationally expensive numerical quadrature method used for the moment evaluations of the maximum-entropy distribution by exploiting its inherent fine-grained parallelism with the parallelism offered by multi-core processors and graphics cards. We show that using a single graphics card as an accelerator allows speed-ups of two orders of magnitude when compared to a serial CPU implementation. To accelerate the time-to-solution for steady-state problems, we propose a new semi-implicit time discretization scheme. The resulting nonlinear system of equations is solved with a Newton type method in the Lagrange multipliers of the dual optimization problem in order to reduce the computational cost. Additionally, fully explicit time-stepping schemes of first and second order accuracy are presented. We investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical schemes for several numerical test cases, including a steady-state shock-structure problem.},

@article{Taniguchi2017,
abstract = {In hyperbolic dissipative systems, the solution of the shock structure is not always continuous and a discontinuous part (sub-shock) appears when the velocity of the shock wave is greater than a critical value. In principle, the sub-shock may occur when the shock velocity {\$}s{\$} reaches one of the characteristic eigenvalues of the hyperbolic system. Nevertheless, Rational Extended Thermodynamics (ET) for a rarefied monatomic gas predicts the sub-shock formation only when {\$}s{\$} exceeds the maximum characteristic velocity of the system evaluated in the unperturbed state {\$}\backslashlambda{\^{}}{\{}\backslashmax{\}}{\_}0{\$}. This fact agrees with a general theorem asserting that continuous shock structure cannot exist for {\$}s {\textgreater}\backslashlambda{\^{}}{\{}\backslashmax{\}}{\_}0 {\$}. In the present paper, first, the shock structure is numerically analyzed on the basis of ET for a rarefied polyatomic gas with {\$}14{\$} independent fields. It is shown that, also in this case, the shock structure is still continuous when {\$}s{\$} meets characteristic velocities except for the maximum one and therefore the sub-shock appears only when {\$}s {\textgreater}\backslashlambda{\^{}}{\{}\backslashmax{\}}{\_}0 {\$}. This example reinforces the conjecture that, the differential systems of ET theories have the special characteristics such that the sub-shock appears only for {\$}s{\$} greater than the unperturbed maximum characteristic velocity. However, in the second part of the paper, we construct a counterexample of this conjecture by using a simple {\$}2 \backslashtimes 2{\$} hyperbolic dissipative system which satisfies all requirements of ET. In contrast to previous results, we show the clear sub-shock formation with a slower shock velocity than the maximum unperturbed characteristic velocity.},

abstract = {The oscillation of a levitated drop is a widely used technique for the measurement of the surface tension and viscosity of liquids. Analyses are mainly based on theories developed in the nineteenth century for surface tension driven oscillations of a spherical, force-free, liquid drop. However, a complete analysis with both analytical and numerical approaches to study the damped oscillations of a viscous liquid drop remains challenging. We first propose in this work an extension of the theory that includes the coupled effects of surface tension and viscosity. The analytical solution permits derivation of both properties simultaneously, which is of interest for fluid with unknown viscosity. Then, the robustness of an Eulerian framework to simulate the fluid flow is discussed. Simulations of different oscillations modes for a liquid iron droplet immersed in a low-density gas and comparisons with the derived theory are detailed and presented.},

abstract = {Much of human inquiry today is focused on collecting massive quantities of data about complex systems, with the underlying assumption that more data leads to more insight into how to solve the challenges facing humanity. However, the questions we wish to address require identifying the impact of interventions on the behavior of a system, and to do this we must know which pieces of information are important and how they fit together. Here we describe why complex systems require different methods than simple systems and provide an overview of the corresponding paradigm shift in physics. We then connect the core ideas of the paradigm shift to information theory and describe how a parallel shift could take place in the study of complex biological and social systems. Finally, we provide a general framework for characterizing the importance of information. Framing scientific inquiry as an effort to objectively determine what is important and unimportant rather than collecting as much information as possible is a means for advancing our understanding and addressing many practical biological and social challenges.},

abstract = {This paper presents anewmethodto simulate liquidvaporflowswith phasechange using a phase-field-like approach. In this method, the liquidvapor interface is de- scribed as a three-dimensional continuous medium across which physical properties have strong but continuous variations. This continuous variation is made possible by imposing that the internal energy of the fluid depends on its density gradient. This description, called the second gradient theory, is numerically attractive since a single system of partial differential equations (PDEs) is necessary to determine the flow in the entire two-phase system, the phase change, the displacement of the interfaces, and their change in topology being a part of their solution. However, to solve these PDEs using a reasonable number of grid points on a fixed grid, the interfaces need to be artificially enlarged. It is shown that this artificial enlargement can be thermody- namically consistent if the thermodynamic behavior of the fluid is modified within the binodal curve. The consequences of this thermodynamic modification are studied in detail. In particular it is shown that, within the frame of the second gradient theory, the interface thickness and the surface tension vary with the mass and heat fluxes across the interface and that these variations increase with the thickness of the inter- face. As a consequence, for a given accuracy, an upper bound exists for the interfacial heat and mass fluxes that can be simulated. Examples of applications in one and two dimensions show the potentialities of the method presented, in particular to deal with moving contact lines, the description of which is a part of the second gradient theory.},

abstract = {In heterogeneous solids such as rocks and concrete, the speed of sound diminishes with the strain amplitude of a dynamic loading (softening). This decrease known as "slow dynamics" occurs at time scales larger than the period of the forcing. Also, hysteresis is observed in the steady-state response. The phenomenological model by Vakhnenko et al. is based on a variable that describes the softening of the material [Phys. Rev. E 70-1, 2004]. However, this model is 1D and it is not thermodynamically admissible. In the present article, a 3D model is derived in the framework of the finite strain theory. An internal variable that describes the softening of the material is introduced, as well as an expression of the specific internal energy. A mechanical constitu-tive law is deduced from the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Moreover, a family of evolution equations for the internal variable is proposed. Here, an evolution equation with one relaxation time is chosen. By construction, this new model of continuum is thermodynamically admissible and dissipative (inelas-tic). In the case of small uniaxial deformations, it is shown analytically that the model reproduces qualitatively the main features of real experiments.},

abstract = {We introduce a mathematical model and related numerical method for numerical modeling of ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) gas flows as an extension of previously known quasi-gasdynamic (QGD) equations. This approach is based on smoothing, or averaging of the original MHD equation system over a small time interval that leads to a new equation system, named quasi-MHD, or QMHD system. The QMHD equations are closely related to the original MHD system except for additional strongly non-linear dissipative ??-terms with a small parameter ?? as a factor. The ??-terms depend on the solution itself and decrease in regions with the small space gradients of the solution. In this sense the QMHD system could be regarded as an approach with adaptive artificial dissipation. The QMHD is a generalization of regularized (or quasi-) gas dynamic equation system suggested in last three decades. In the QMHD numerical method the evolution of all physical variables is presented in a non-split divergence form. Divergence-free evolution of the magnetic field provides by using a constrained transport method based on Faraday's law of induction. Accuracy and convergence of the QMHD method is verified on a wide set of standard MHD tests including the 3D Orszag-Tang vortex flow.},

We develop a Multigrid Precon-ditioned fluid solver for the Locally Averaged Navier Stokes equation. This is discretized purely on a semi-staggered standard MPM grid. Sedimentation is modeled with the Drucker-Prager elastoplasticity flow rule, enhanced by a novel particle density estimation method for converting particles between representations of either continuum or discrete points. Fluid and sediment are two-way coupled through a momentum exchange force that can be easily resolved with two MPM background grids. We present various results to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.},

abstract = {We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg–de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.},

abstract = {Understanding the interplay among process parameters, microstructure, and presence of defects is critical to optimizing Additive Manufacturing (AM) routes for producing specialty alloy parts with unique geometry, properties, and compositional features. However, since it is not feasible to obtain experimental results for every possible set of AM process, process conditions, and alloy composition, computational modeling is becoming an increasingly important tool for understanding key physical processes, with the hope of developing a framework for AM materials design. One such physical process of interest is the dendritic solidification within grains; we implement a Cellular Automata (CA) model for coupled solute transport and growth of cellular and dendritic $\beta$-Ti alloy colonies under thermal conditions typically encountered in AM processes. Quantitative agreement with analytical models of the undercooling-solidification velocity relationship was achieved, as well as qualitative agreement with trends in primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS), secondary arm development, and compositional profile with changes in solidification conditions. The roles of solute diffusivity, interfacial energy, and alloying addition are considered as well. Under rapid solidification conditions, extension to include local non-equilibrium for solute allowed for the modeling of solute trapping along dendrite stems as well as qualitative representation of the dendritic to banded morphology transition. To quantitatively reproduce non-equilibrium solidification at the dendritic colony scale and more accurately estimate rapid solidification microstructures, use of multiple grids or more complex CA rules would be in order.},

abstract = {We develop high-resolution shock-capturing numerical schemes for hyperbolic systems with relaxation. In such systems the relaxation time may vary from order-1 to much less than unity. When the relaxation time is small, the relaxation term becomes very strong and highly stiff, and underresolved numerical schemes may produce spurious results. Usually one cannot decouple the problem into separate regimes and handle different regimes with different methods. Thus it is important to have a scheme that works uniformly with respect to the relaxation time. Using the Broadwell model of the nonlinear Boltzmann equation we develop a second-order scheme that works effectively, with a fixed spatial and temporal discretization, for all ranges of the mean free path. Formal uniform consistency proof for a first-order scheme and numerical convergence proof for the second-order scheme are also presented. We also make numerical comparisons of the new scheme with some other schemes. This study is motivated by the reentry problem in hypersonic computations.},

abstract = {First- and second-order accurate numerical methods, implemented for CPUs, underpin the majority of industrial CFD solvers. Whilst this technology has proven very successful at solving steady-state problems via a Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes approach, its utility for undertaking scale-resolving simulations of unsteady flows is less clear. High-order methods for unstructured grids and GPU accelerators have been proposed as an enabling technology for unsteady scale-resolving simulations of flow over complex geometries. In this study we systematically compare accuracy and cost of the high-order Flux Reconstruction solver PyFR running on GPUs and the industry-standard solver STAR-CCM+ running on CPUs when applied to a range of unsteady flow problems. Specifically, we perform comparisons of accuracy and cost for isentropic vortex advection (EV), decay of the Taylor–Green vortex (TGV), turbulent flow over a circular cylinder, and turbulent flow over an SD7003 aerofoil. We consider two configurations of STAR-CCM+: a second-order configuration, and a third-order configuration, where the latter was recommended by CD-adapco for more effective computation of unsteady flow problems. Results from both PyFR and STAR-CCM+ demonstrate that third-order schemes can be more accurate than second-order schemes for a given cost e.g. going from second- to third-order, the PyFR simulations of the EV and TGV achieve 75× and 3× error reduction respectively for the same or reduced cost, and STAR-CCM+ simulations of the cylinder recovered wake statistics significantly more accurately for only twice the cost. Moreover, advancing to higher-order schemes on GPUs with PyFR was found to offer even further accuracy vs. cost benefits relative to industry-standard tools.},

We show that these inconsistencies are consequences of the Lagrangian derivation that models viscous stresses rather than diffusion. A new model for compressible and diffusive (viscous and heat conducting) flows of an ideal gas, is derived in a purely Eulerian framework. We propose that these equations supersede the Navier-Stokes equations. A few numerical experiments demonstrate some differences and similarities between the new system and the Navier-Stokes equations.},

@article{VanderVaart2013,
abstract = {We present a detailed comparison of the rheology of concentrated hard and soft-sphere suspensions using a variety of techniques including large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS). While the soft spheres are jammed and exhibit permanent contact, the hard-sphere suspensions are below close packing where particle collisions lead to an effective modulus. Oscillatory shear measurements are used to determine the strain-dependent viscoelastic moduli and yield stress. A recent scheme is applied to interpret LAOS data in terms of a sequence of physical processes [Rogers et al., J. Rheol. 55, 435–458 (2011a)], revealing different characteristics of yielding, flow, and structural rejuvenation in the two systems. While for hard spheres, yielding and flow are governed by the breaking and rejuvenation of the nearest neighbor cage; for soft spheres, the particle compliance gives rise to a much more gradual yielding. We address the effect of particle softness directly by measuring the single-particle modulus with atomic force microscopy, and linking it to the suspension modulus via the pair correlation function determined by microscopy.},

@article{Ortigosa2016a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, The Author(s). In this paper, a new computational framework is presented for the analysis of nonlinear beam finite elements subjected to large strains. Specifically, the methodology recently introduced in Bonet et al. (Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng  283:1061–1094, 2015) in the context of three dimensional polyconvex elasticity is extended to the geometrically exact beam model of Simo (Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 49:55–70, 1985), the starting point of so many other finite element beam type formulations. This new variational framework can be viewed as a continuum degenerate formulation which, moreover, is enhanced by three key novelties. First, in order to facilitate the implementation of the sophisticated polyconvex constitutive laws particularly associated with beams undergoing large strains, a novel tensor cross product algebra by Bonet et al. (Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng  283:1061–1094, 2015) is adopted, leading to an elegant and physically meaningful representation of an otherwise complex computational framework. Second, the paper shows how the novel algebra facilitates the re-expression of any invariant of the deformation gradient, its cofactor and its determinant in terms of the classical beam strain measures. The latter being very useful whenever a classical beam implementation is preferred. This is particularised for the case of a Mooney–Rivlin model although the technique can be straightforwardly generalised to other more complex isotropic and anisotropic polyconvex models. Third, the connection between the two most accepted restrictions for the definition of constitutive models in three dimensional elasticity and beams is shown, bridging the gap between the continuum and its degenerate beam description. This is carried out via a novel insightful representation of the tangent operator.},

For the spatial discretization, we use low order finite elements, with, in particular, linear discretization for the velocity and the pressure, stabilized by a Brezzi-Pitk{\"{a}}ranta perturbation term. We illustrate this numerical strategy through two well-known problems, namely the hydrodynamic benchmark of the lid-driven cavity and the natural convection benchmark of the differentially heated cavity. For both, we assess our numerical scheme against previous publications, for Newtonian flow or in the creeping flow regime, and propose novel results in the case of Bingham fluid non-creeping flows. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A kinetic formulation of elasto-viscoplasticity is proposed. It consists of a non-linear Maxwell-like viscoelastic constitutive equation (CE) that describes the evolution of the recoverable (elastic) part of the total Finger strain tensor, a thermodynamic formulation of stress tensor dependence on the elastic strain tensor, and a kinetic equation for a scalar "bonding" factor. The set of CEs does not contain any mathematical yield criterion but predicts anisotropic yield values for stress as a transition from solid-like deformations to flow through a bifurcation. The set of CEs proposed is shown to be globally Hadamard stable. The dissipative stability is also discussed briefly. In the case when the elastic strains are sufficiently small, the second-order approach is developed. Within this approach, several problems of simple shearing are analyzed to illustrate the model behavior. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, we construct very efficient high-order schemes for general time-dependent advection-diffusion problems, based on the first-order hyperbolic system method. Extending the previous work on the second-order time-dependent hyperbolic advection-diffusion scheme (Mazaheri and Nishikawa, NASA/TM-2014-218175, 2014), we construct third-, fourth-, and sixth-order accurate schemes by modifying the source term discretization. In this paper, two techniques for the source term discretization are proposed; (1) reformulation of the source terms with their divergence forms and (2) correction to the trapezoidal rule for the source term discretization. We construct spatially third- and fourth-order schemes from the former technique. These schemes require computations of the gradients and second-derivatives of the source terms. From the latter technique, we construct spatially third-, fourth-, and sixth-order schemes by using the gradients and second-derivatives for the source terms, except the fourth-order scheme, which does not require the second derivatives of the source term and thus is even less computationally expensive than the third-order schemes. We then construct high-order time-accurate schemes by incorporating a high-order backward difference formula as a source term. These schemes are very efficient in that high-order accuracy is achieved for both the solution and the gradient only by the improved source term discretization. A very rapid Newton-type convergence is achieved by a compact second-order Jacobian formulation. The numerical results are presented for both steady and time-dependent linear and nonlinear advection-diffusion problems, demonstrating these powerful features. ?? 2014.},

Moreover, a generalized chemical affinity is revealed which provides natural means of coupling diffusion with chemical reactions.

abstract = {Typical conservative smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) approximations of the gradient of a scalar field introduce two errors: one (smoothing error) is due to smoothing of the gradient by an integration associated with a kernel function; the other (integration error) is due to approximating the integration by summation over all particles within the kernel support. When particles are not on a uniform grid, the integration error leads to violation of zero-order consistency, i.e. the inability to reproduce a constant field. In this paper we confirm that partition of unity is the condition under which the conservative SPH approximation achieves both consistence and convergence. We show that this condition can be achieved by relaxing a particle distribution under a constant pressure field and invariant particle volume. The resulting particle distribution is very similar to that is typical for liquid molecules. We further show that with two different typical kernel functions the SPH approximation, upon satisfying the partition of unity property, is able to achieve very high-order of the integration error, which previously could be shown only with particles on a uniform grid. The background pressure used in a weakly compressible SPH simulation implies a self-relaxation mechanism, which explains that convergence with respect to increasing particle numbers could be obtained in SPH simulations, although not predicted by previous numerical analysis. Furthermore, by relating the integration error to the background pressure, we explain why the previously proposed transport-velocity formulation of SPH (S. Adami et al. (2013) [1]) is able to achieve unprecedented accuracy and stability.},

After a description of the problems and controversies involving the physics of torsion, a comprehensive presentation of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity is made. According to this theory, curvature and torsion are alternative ways of describing the gravitational field, and consequently related to the same degrees of freedom of gravity. However, more general gravity theories, like for example Einstein-Cartan and gauge theories for the Poincare and the affine groups, consider curvature and torsion as representing independent degrees of freedom. By using an active version of the strong equivalence principle, a possible solution to this conceptual question is reviewed. This solution favors ultimately the teleparallel point of view, and consequently the completeness of general relativity. A discussion of the consequences for gravitation is presented.},

abstract = {PyFR is an open-source high-order accurate computational fluid dynamics solver for unstructured grids. In this paper we detail how PyFR has been extended to run on mixed element meshes, and a range of hardware platforms, including heterogeneous multi-node systems. Performance of our implementation is benchmarked using pure hexahedral and mixed prismatic-tetrahedral meshes of the void space around a circular cylinder. Specifically, for each mesh performance is assessed at various orders of accuracy on three different hardware platforms; an NVIDIA Tesla K40c GPU, an Intel Xeon E5-2697 v2 CPU, and an AMD FirePro W9100 GPU. Performance is then assessed on a heterogeneous multi-node system constructed from a mix of the aforementioned hardware. Results demonstrate that PyFR achieves performance portability across various hardware platforms. In particular, the ability of PyFR to target individual platforms with their 'native' language leads to significantly enhanced performance cf. targeting each platform with OpenCL alone. PyFR is also found to be performant on the heterogeneous multi-node system, achieving a significant fraction of the available FLOP/s. Finally, each mesh is used to undertake nominally fifth-order accurate long-time simulations of unsteady flow over a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 3900 using a cluster of NVIDIA K20c GPUs. Long-time dynamics of the wake are studied in detail, and results are found to be in excellent agreement with previous experimental/numerical data. All results were obtained with PyFR v0.2.2, which is freely available under a 3-Clause New Style BSD license (see www.pyfr.org).},

abstract = {The Nobel Prize winning confirmation in 1998 of the accelerated expansion of our Universe put into sharp focus the need of a consistent theoretical model to explain the origin of this acceleration. As a result over the past two decades there has been a huge theoretical and observational effort into improving our understanding of the Universe. The cosmological equations describing the dynamics of a homogeneous and isotropic Universe are systems of ordinary differential equations, and one of the most elegant ways these can be investigated is by casting them into the form of dynamical systems. This allows the use of powerful analytical and numerical methods to gain a quantitative understanding of the cosmological dynamics derived by the models under study. In this review we apply these techniques to cosmology. We begin with a brief introduction to dynamical systems, fixed points, linear stability theory, Lyapunov stability, centre manifold theory and more advanced topics relating to the global structure of the solutions. Using this machinery we then analyse a large number of cosmological models and show how the stability conditions allow them to be tightly constrained and even ruled out on purely theoretical grounds. We are also able to identify those models which deserve further in depth investigation through comparison with observational data. This review is a comprehensive and detailed study of dynamical systems applications to cosmological models focusing on the late-time behaviour of our Universe, and in particular on its accelerated expansion. In self contained sections we present a large number of models ranging from canonical and non-canonical scalar fields, interacting models and non-scalar field models through to modified gravity scenarios. Selected models are discussed in details and interpreted in the context of late-time cosmology.},

We present a framework to construct structure-preserving integrators for linearly damped systems by splitting the system into reversible and irreversible parts. The reversible part, which is typically a Hamiltonian system, is solved by using a symplectic method (e.g., Verlet), for which an associated modified Hamiltonian in the form of a series expansion can be obtained by using backward error analysis. The modified Hamiltonian is then used to adjust the irreversible part in such a way that the modified total energy for the whole system can be conserved. Our findings are verified by various numerical experiments, demonstrating the superiority of structure-preserving integrators over alternative schemes in terms of the accuracy control of both energy conservation and entropy production as well as the preservation of the dissipation rate.},

We analyze the structure of eigenvalues of the multi-index matrix entering the (linear) relation between canonical velocities and momenta to obtain the set of primary constraints. The canonical Hamiltonian is then built with the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of that matrix. The set of constraints, including the subsequent secondary constraints, completes a first class algebra. This means that all of them generate gauge transformations. The gauge freedoms are basically the diffeomorphisms, and the (local) Lorentz transformations of the vielbein.

abstract = {Teleparallel gravity has significantly increased in popularity in recent decades, bringing attention to Einstein's other theory of gravity. In this Review, we relate this form of geometry to the broader metric-affine approach to forming gravitational theories where we describe a systematic way of constructing consistent teleparallel theories that respect certain physical conditions such as local Lorentz invariance. We first use teleparallel gravity to formulate a teleparallel equivalent of general relativity which is dynamically equivalent to general relativity but which may have different behaviors for other scenarios, such as quantum gravity. After setting this foundation, we describe the plethora of modified teleparallel theories of gravity that have been proposed in the literature. In the second part of the Review, we first survey works in teleparallel astrophysics literature where we focus on the open questions in this regime of physics. We then discuss the cosmological consequences for the various formulations of teleparallel gravity. We do this at background level by exploring works using various approaches ranging from dynamical systems to Noether symmetries, and more. Naturally, we then discuss perturbation theory, firstly by giving a concise approach in which this can be applied in teleparallel gravity theories and then apply it to a number of important theories in the literature. Finally, we examine works in observational and precision cosmology across the plethora of proposal theories. This is done using some of the latest observations and is used to tackle cosmological tensions which may be alleviated in teleparallel cosmology. We also introduce a number of recent works in the application of machine learning to gravity, we do this through deep learning and Gaussian processes, together with discussions about other approaches in the literature.},

abstract = {We develop a new framework for the modelling of charged fluid dynamics in general relativity. The model, which builds on a recently developed variational multi-fluid model for dissipative fluids, accounts for relevant effects like the inertia of both charge currents and heat and, for mature systems, the decoupling of superfluid components. We discuss how the model compares to standard relativistic magnetohydronamics and consider the connection between the fluid dynamics, the microphysics and the underlying equation of state. As illustrations of the formalism, we consider three distinct two-fluid models describing i) an Ohm's law for resistive charged flows, ii) a relativistic heat equation, and iii) an equation representing the momentum of a decoupled superfluid component. As a more complex example, we also formulate a three-fluid model which demonstrates the thermo-electric effect. This framework allows us to model neutron stars (and related systems) at a hierarchy of increasingly complex levels, and should enable us to make progress on a range of exciting problems in astrophysics and cosmology.},

abstract = {New perspectives on the phase field approach in modeling deformation and fracture at the fundamental defect level are reviewed. When applied at sub-angstrom length scales the phase field crystal (PFC) model is able to describe thermally averaged atomic configurations of defects and defect processes on diffusional timescales. When applied at individual defect levels the microscopic phase field (MPF) model is a superset of the Cahn-Hilliard description of chemical inhomogeneities and the Peierls (cohesive zone) description of displacive inhomogeneities. A unique feature associated with the MPF model is its ability to predict fundamental properties of individual defects such as size, formation energy, saddle point configuration and activation energy of defect nuclei, and the micromechanisms of their mutual interactions, directly using ab initio calculations as model inputs. When applied at the mesoscopic level the coarse grained phase field (CGPF) models have the ability to predict the evolution of microstructures consisting of a large assembly of both chemically and mechanically interacting defects through coupled displacive and diffusional mechanisms. It is noted that the purpose of the MPF model is fundamentally different from that of the CGPF models. The latter have been used primarily to study microstructural evolution with user-supplied linear response rate laws, defect energies and mobilities. Combined phase field simulations hold great promise in modeling deformation and fracture with complex microstructural and chemical interactions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {The accurate simulation of compressible multi-phase flows with surface tension effects is currently still one of the most challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The basic difficulties are the capturing of the correct interface dynamics between the two fluids as well as the computation of the interface curvature. In this paper, we present a novel path-conservative finite volume discretization of the continuum surface force method (CSF) of Brackbill et al. to account for the surface tension effect due to curvature of the phase interface. This is achieved in the context of a diffuse interface approach, based on the seven equation Baer-Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flows. Such diffuse interface methods for compressible multi-phase flows including capillary effects have first been proposed by Perigaud and Saurel. In the CSF method, the surface tension effect is replaced by a volume force, which is usually integrated as a classical volume source term. However, since this source term contains the gradient of a color function that is convected with the flow velocity, we propose to integrate the CSF source term as a non-conservative product and not simply as a source term, following the ideas on path-conservative finite volume schemes put forward by Castro and Par{\'{e}}s. For that purpose, we use the new generalized Osher-type Riemann solver (DOT), recently proposed by Dumbser and Toro and compare it with a path-conservative Roe and Rusanov scheme. Via numerical evidence we can show that if the curvature computation is exact, our new scheme is well-balanced for a steady circular bubble in equilibrium according to the Young-Laplace law. This means that the pressure jump term across the interface in the momentum equation is exactly balanced with the surface tension force. We apply our scheme to several one- and two-dimensional test problems, including 1D Riemann problems, an oscillating droplet, as well as a deforming droplet initially attached to a wall and which is subject to gravity and surface tension forces. Finally, we also check the rising of a gas bubble due to buoyancy forces. We compare our numerical results with those published previously in the literature.},

abstract = {We are interested in the modelling of multi-dimensional turbulent hydraulic jumps in convergent radial flow. To describe the formation of intensive eddies (rollers) at the front of the hydraulic jump, a new model of shear shallow water flows is used. The governing equations form a non-conservative hyperbolic system with dissipative source terms. The structure of equations is reminiscent of generic Reynolds-averaged Euler equations for barotropic compressible turbulent flows. Two types of dissipative term are studied. The first one corresponds to a Ch{\'{e}}zy-like dissipation rate, and the second one to a standard energy dissipation rate commonly used in compressible turbulence. Both of them guarantee the positive definiteness of the Reynolds stress tensor. The equations are rewritten in polar coordinates and numerically solved by using an original splitting procedure. Numerical results for both types of dissipation are presented and qualitatively compared with the experimental works. The results show both experimentally observed phenomena (cusp formation at the front of the hydraulic jump) as well as new flow patterns (the shape of the hydraulic jump becomes a rotating square).},

abstract = {Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a well-established approach to model fluids in astrophysical problems, thanks to its geometric flexibility and ability to automatically adjust the spatial resolution to the clumping of matter. However, a number of recent studies have emphasized inaccuracies of SPH in the treatment of fluid instabilities. The origin of these numerical problems can be traced back to spurious surface effects across contact discontinuities, and to SPH's inherent prevention of mixing at the particle level. We here investigate a new fluid particle model where the density estimate is carried out with the help of an auxiliary mesh constructed as the Voronoi tessellation of the simulation particles instead of an adaptive smoothing kernel. This Voronoi-based approach improves the ability of the scheme to represent sharp contact discontinuities. We show that this eliminates spurious surface tension effects present in SPH and that play a role in suppressing certain fluid instabilities. We find that the new `Voronoi Particle Hydrodynamics' described here produces comparable results than SPH in shocks, and better ones in turbulent regimes of pure hydrodynamical simulations. We also discuss formulations of the artificial viscosity needed in this scheme and how judiciously chosen correction forces can be derived in order to maintain a high degree of particle order and hence a regular Voronoi mesh. This is especially helpful in simulating self-gravitating fluids with existing gravity solvers used for N-body simulations.},

abstract = {We study the rheology of dense granular flows for frictionless spherocylinders by means of 3D numerical simulations. As in the case of spherical particles, the effective friction {\$}\backslashmu{\$} is an increasing function of the inertial number {\$}I{\$}, and we systematically investigate the dependence of {\$}\backslashmu{\$} on the particle aspect ratio {\$}Q{\$}, as well as that of the normal stress differences, the volume fraction and the coordination number. We show in particular that the quasi-static friction coefficient is non-monotonic with {\$}Q{\$}: from the spherical case {\$}Q=1{\$}, it first sharply increases, reaches a maximum around {\$}Q \backslashsimeq 1.05{\$}, and then gently decreases, reaching back its initial value for {\$}Q \backslashsimeq 2{\$}. We provide a microscopic interpretation for this unexpected behavior through the analysis of the distribution of dissipative contacts around the particles: as compared to spheres, slightly elongated grains enhance contacts in their central cylindrical band, whereas at larger aspect ratios particles tend to align and dissipate by preferential contacts at their hemispherical caps.},

abstract = {In this compendium of essays, some of the world's leading thinkers discuss their conceptions of space and time, as viewed through the lens of their own discipline. With an epilogue on the limits of human understanding, this volume hosts contributions from six or more diverse fields. It presumes only rudimentary background knowledge on the part of the reader.Time and again, through the prism of intellect, humans have tried to diffract reality into various distinct, yet seamless, atomic, yet holistic, independent, yet interrelated disciplines and have attempted to study it contextually. Philosophers debate the paradoxes, or engage in meditations, dialogues and reflections on the content and nature of space and time. Physicists, too, have been trying to mold space and time to fit their notions concerning micro- and macro-worlds. Mathematicians focus on the abstract aspects of space, time and measurement. While cognitive scientists ponder over the perceptual and experiential facets of our consciousness of space and time, computer scientists theoretically and practically try to optimize the space-time complexities in storing and retrieving data/information. The list is never-ending. Linguists, logicians, artists, evolutionary biologists, geographers etc., all are trying to weave a web of understanding around the same duo. However, our endeavour into a world of such endless imagination is restrained by intellectual dilemmas such as: Can humans comprehend everything? Are there any limits? Can finite thought fathom infinity? We have sought far and wide among the best minds to furnish articles that provide an overview of the above topics. We hope that, through this journey, a symphony of patterns and tapestry of intuitions will emerge, providing the reader with insights into the questions: What is Space? What is Time?Chapter [15] of this book is available open access under a CC BY 4.0 license.},

@article{Xia2016,
abstract = {A mesoscopic model has been established to investigate the thermodynamic mechanisms and densification behavior of nickel-based superalloy during additive manufacturing/three-dimensional (3D) printing (AM/3DP) by numerical simulation, using a finite volume method (FVM). The influence of the applied linear energy density (LED) on dimensions of the molten pool, thermodynamic mechanisms within the pool, bubbles migration and resultant densification behavior of AM/3DP-processed superalloy has been discussed. It reveals that the center of the molten pool slightly shifts with a lagging of 4$\mu$m towards the center of the moving laser beam. The Marangoni convection, which has various flow patterns, plays a crucial role in intensifying the convective heat and mass transfer, which is responsible for the bubbles migration and densification behavior of AM/3DP-processed parts. At an optimized LED of 221.5J/m, the outward convection favors the numerous bubbles to escape from the molten pool easily and the resultant considerably high relative density of 98.9{\%} is achieved. However, as the applied LED further increases over 249.5J/m, the convection pattern is apparently intensified with the formation of vortexes and the bubbles tend to be entrapped by the rotating flow within the molten pool, resulting in a large amount of residual porosity and a sharp reduction in densification of the superalloy. The change rules of the relative density and the corresponding distribution of porosity obtained by experiments are in accordance with the simulation results.},

@article{Aposporidis2014,
abstract = {Copyright ? 2014, Kent State University.In the numerical solution of visco-plastic fluids, one of the hard problems is the effective detection of rigid or plug regions. These occur when the strain-rate tensor vanishes and consequently the equations for the fluid region become singular. In order to manage this lack of regularity, different approaches are possible. Regularization procedures replace the plug regions with high-viscosity fluid regions, featuring a regularization parameter ? {\textgreater} 0. In Aposporidis et al. [Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg., 200 (2011), pp. 2434-2446], an augmented formulation for Bingham fluids was introduced to improve the regularity properties of the problem. Results presented there show that the augmented formulation is more effective for numerical purposes and it works also in the non-regularized case (? = 0) without a significant degradation of the non-linear solver's performance. However, when solving high-dimensional Bingham problems, the augmented formulation leads to more challenging linear systems. In this paper we develop a strategy for preconditioning large non-regularized augmented Bingham systems. We use the regularized problem as a preconditioner for the non-regularized case. Then, we resort to a nonlinear geometric multilevel preconditioner to accelerate the convergence of the flexible Krylov linear solver for the regularized Bingham preconditioner. Results presented here demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategy also in realistic (non-academic) test cases.},

abstract = {In this paper we question the status of TEGR, the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity,as a gauge theory of translations. We observe that TEGR (in its usual translation-gauge view) does not seem to realize the generally admitted requirements for a gauge theory for some symmetry group {\$}G{\$}: namely it does not present a mathematical structure underlying the theory which relates to a principal {\$}G{\$}-bundle and the choice of a connection on it (the gauge field). We point out that, while it is usually presented as absent, the gauging of the Lorentz symmetry is actually present in the theory, and that the choice of an Erhesmann connection to describe the gauge field makes the translations difficult to implement (mainly because there is in general no principal translation-bundle). We finally propose to use the Cartan Geometry and the Cartan connection as an alternative approach, naturally arising from the solution of the issues just mentioned, to obtain a more mathematically sound framework for TEGR.},

However, standard moment methods like Grad's approach lack hyperbolicity of the equations. This can lead to instabilities and nonphysical solutions. Based on recent developments in this field we have recently derived a quadrature-based moment method leading to globally hyperbolic and rotationally invariant moment equations. We present a 1D five moment case of the equations and use numerical simulations to compare the new model with standard approaches. The tests are done with dedicated numerical methods to solve the new non-conservative moment equations. These first results using the new method show the accuracy of the new method and its benefits compared with Grad's method or other existing models like discrete velocity.},

abstract = {Many astrophysical processes involving magnetic fields and quasi-stationary processes are well described when assuming the fluid as a perfect conductor. For these systems, the ideal-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) description captures the dynamics effectively and a number of well-tested techniques exist for its numerical solution. Yet, there are several astrophysical processes involving magnetic fields which are highly dynamical and for which resistive effects can play an important role. The numerical modeling of such non-ideal MHD flows is significantly more challenging as the resistivity is expected to change of several orders of magnitude across the flow and the equations are then either of hyperbolic-parabolic nature or hyperbolic with stiff terms. We here present a novel approach for the solution of these relativistic resistive MHD equations exploiting the properties of implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge Kutta methods. By examining a number of tests we illustrate the accuracy of our approach under a variety of conditions and highlight its robustness when compared with alternative methods, such as the Strang-splitting. Most importantly, we show that our approach allows one to treat, within a unified framework, both those regions of the flow which are fluid-pressure dominated (such as in the interior of compact objects) and those which are instead magnetic-pressure dominated (such as in their magnetospheres)},

@article{Gray2001,
abstract = {The standard smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation of fluid dynamics can exhibit an instability called the tensile instability. This instability may occur with both positive and negative pressure. Usually the effects are small, but in the case of elastic or brittle solids the effects may be severe. Under tension, a brittle solid can fracture, but it is difficult to disentangle the physical fracture and fragmentation from the nonphysical clumping of SPH particles due to the tensile instability. Recently, one of us (JJM) has shown how this instability can be removed by an artificial stress which introduces negligible errors in long-wavelength modes. In this paper we show how the algorithm can be improved by basing the artificial stress on the signs of the principal stresses. We determine the parameters of the artificial stress from the dispersion relation for elastic waves in a uniform material. We apply the algorithm to oscillating beams, colliding rings and brittle solids. The results are in very good agreement with theory, and with other high-accuracy methods. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Attention is concentrated on elucidating the difference between the energymomentum tensors of Minkowski and Abraham. It is emphasized either of these can be used in practice to consider the exchange of energy and momentum between an emitter and a medium in which the emitter is placed. However, to analyze the processes in the medium itself, Abraham's should be used because it takes into account Abraham's volume force, which acts even on a homogeneous medium (whereas according to Minkowski no force acts at all on a transparent, homogeneous medium with density-independent permittivity in an electromagnetic field).},

abstract = {Although many continental rifts and passive margins are magmatic, some are not. This observation prompted endmember views of the mechanisms driving continental rifting, where magma-rich or active rifts would be caused by deep mantle plumes, whereas magma-poor or passive rifts would result from the stretching of the lithosphere under far-field plate forces. The Central East African Rift provides a unique setting to investigate the mechanisms of continental rifting because it juxtaposes a magma-rich (eastern) branch and magma-poor (western) branch on either side of the 250-km-thick Tanzanian craton. Here we investigate this contrasted behavior using a high-resolution rheologically consistent three-dimensional thermo-mechanical numerical model. The model reproduces the rise of a mantle plume beneath a craton experiencing tensional far-field stress. In our numerical experiments the plume is deflected by the cratonic keel and preferentially channelled along one of its sides. This leads to the coeval development of magma-rich and magma-poor rifts along opposite craton sides, fed by melt from a single mantle source. Our numerical experiments show strong similarities to the observed evolution of the Central East African Rift, reconcile the passive and active rift models, and demonstrate the possibility of developing both magmatic and amagmatic rifts in identical geotectonic environments.},

We employ a three-field mixed formulation to calculate displacement, fluid flux and pressure directly and introduce a Lagrange multiplier to enforce flux boundary conditions. We use a low order approximation, namely, continuous piecewise-linear approximation for the displacements and fluid flux, and piecewise-constant approximation for the pressure. This results in a simple matrix structure with low bandwidth. The method is stable in both the limiting cases of small and large permeability. Moreover, the discontinuous pressure space enables efficient approximation of steep gradients such as those occurring due to rapidly changing material coefficients or boundary conditions, both of which are commonly seen in physical and biological applications.},

abstract = {This review summarizes theoretical progress in the field of active matter, placing it in the context of recent experiments. This approach offers a unified framework for the mechanical and statistical properties of living matter: biofilaments and molecular motors in vitro or in vivo, collections of motile microorganisms, animal flocks, and chemical or mechanical imitations. A major goal of this review is to integrate several approaches proposed in the literature, from semimicroscopic to phenomenologi-cal. In particular, first considered are ''dry'' systems, defined as those where momentum is not conserved due to friction with a substrate or an embedding porous medium. The differences and similarities between two types of orientationally ordered states, the nematic and the polar, are clarified. Next, the active hydrodynamics of suspensions or ''wet'' systems is discussed and the relation with and difference from the dry case, as well as various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter, are highlighted. Further highlighted are various large-scale insta-bilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter. Various semimicroscopic derivations of the continuum theory are discussed and connected, highlighting the unifying and generic nature of the continuum model. Throughout the review, the experimental relevance of these theories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the cytoskeleton of living cells, and vibrated granular material is discussed. Promising extensions toward greater realism in specific contexts from cell biology to animal behavior are suggested, and remarks are given on some exotic active-matter analogs. Last, the outlook for a quantitative understanding of active matter, through the interplay of detailed theory with controlled experiments on simplified systems, with living or artificial constituents, is summarized.},

@article{Pakter2018,
abstract = {It has been observed empirically that two-dimensional vortices tend to cluster, forming a giant vortex. To account for this observation, Onsager introduced the concept of negative absolute temperature in equilibrium statistical mechanics. In this Letter, we show that in the thermodynamic limit a system of interacting vortices does not relax to the thermodynamic equilibrium but becomes trapped in a nonequilibrium stationary state. We show that the vortex distribution in this nonequilibrium stationary state has a characteristic core-halo structure, which can be predicted a priori. All the theoretical results are compared with explicit molecular dynamics simulations. Seventy years ago, Onsager presented his celebrated theory of large-scale vortex formation in two-dimensional turbulence, which for the first time introduced the notion of negative temperature in physics [1]. Onsager worked in the framework introduced earlier by Helmholtz [2] and Kirchhoff [3], in which the solution to the incompressible 2D Euler equation is written in terms of a pseudoscalar vorticity $\Gamma$ðr; tÞ ¼ ½∇ × uðr; tÞ {\textperiodcentered} ˆ z, where uðr; tÞ is the velocity of fluid at position r andˆzandˆ andˆz is the unit vector normal to the fluid plane. The incompressibility condition for the Euler equation allows one to introduce a stream function $\phi$ðr; tÞ such that uðr; tÞ ¼ ∇ × $\phi$ðr; tÞˆztÞˆz, which satisfies the Poisson equation ∇ 2 $\phi$ðr; tÞ ¼ −$\Gamma$ðr; tÞ, the solution to which can be written in terms of an appropriate Green function: $\phi$ðr; tÞ ¼ Z Gðr; r 0 Þ$\Gamma$ðr 0 ; tÞdr 0 : ð1Þ In an open space, the Green function corresponds to the 2D Coulomb-like potential Gðr; r 0 Þ ¼ −ð1=2$\pi$Þ ln jr − r 0 j. Furthermore, it is easy to show that the vorticity field is simply advected by the flow, d$\Gamma$ðr; tÞ=dt ¼ 0. If we suppose that the vorticity field is composed of various point vortices $\Gamma$ðrÞ ¼ P $\Gamma$ i $\delta$(r − r i ðtÞ), their velocity is then the same as of the fluid, {\_} r i ¼ ∇ i × P j≠i $\Gamma$ j Gðr i ; r j ÞˆzÞˆz, and the vortex dynamics has a Hamilton-like structure: $\Gamma$ i {\_} x i ¼ ∂H ∂y i ; $\Gamma$ i {\_} y i ¼ − ∂H ∂x i : ð2Þ The Kirchhoff function is H ¼ P i{\textless}j $\Gamma$ i $\Gamma$ j Gðr; r 0 Þ, where we have removed the singular term, and the x and y coordinates of a vortex are the conjugate variables. Besides the total energy, the system Eqs. (2) has two other invariants corresponding to the conservation of the total linear and angular momentums of the fluid: P ¼ X i $\Gamma$ i r i ; L ¼ X i $\Gamma$ i r 2 i : ð3Þ Onsager's argument for the formation of large-scale vortex structures is beautiful in its simplicity [1]. Suppose that N vortices are confined in a bounded region of area A. Onsager suggested that in the thermodynamic limit, N → ∞, Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics can be applied to the vortex fluid. The maximum entropy state would then correspond to a completely disordered vortex gas occupying uniformly all of the area A. The energy of this fully disordered state, E c , can be easily calculated using the appropriate Green function. This means that, if E {\textgreater} E c , any inhomogeneous vortex distribution will have lower entropy than SðE c Þ so that entropy SðEÞ will be a decreasing function of the energy. Since the temperature is 1=T ¼ ∂S=∂E, the vortex gas with energy E {\textgreater} E c will have a negative temperature. In equilibrium, the probability of a given vortex configuration is proportional to the Boltzmann weight-a negative temperature state [4], therefore , would imply clustering of vortices of the same sign, which would then explain the spontaneous appearance of large-scale vorticity in 2D turbulence. Onsager's theory relies on two fundamental assumptions-the existence of a thermodynamic limit and ergodicity of vortex motion. Because of the long-range interaction, the usual thermodynamic limit-N → ∞, A → ∞ with N=A constant-is not appropriate except for systems with an equal number of cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices, in which case it was proven rigorously that the critical energy is infinite and the temperature is always positive [5]. The interesting case is then a non-neutral system, in particular, the one in which there are only vortices of one sign and which for simplicity we will assume all to have the same vorticity $\Gamma$. In this case, the appropriate thermodynamic limit is N → ∞, $\Gamma$ → 0, with $\Omega$ ¼ $\Gamma$N remaining constant [6,7]. In this limit, the correlations PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 121, 020602 (2018) 0031-9007=18=121(2)=020602(5) 020602-1},

Typical rarefaction effects, e.g., heat flux parallel to the wall and the characteristic dip in the temperature profile in Poiseuille flow, are reproduced accurately.

The diffuse-interface complex-fluid model is described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard (NSCH) equations with preferential-wetting boundary conditions at the fluid-solid interface. The corresponding fluid traction on the interface includes a capillary-stress contribution,and the dynamic interface condition comprises the traction exerted by the non-uniform fluid-solid surface tension. We present a weak formulation of the aggregated CSFI problem,based on an arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation of the NSCH equations and a proper reformulation of the complex-fluid traction and the fluid-solid surface tension. To validate the presented CSFI model,we present numerical results and conduct a comparison to experimental data for a droplet on a soft substrate.},

@article{Miehe2016,
abstract = {The prediction of fluid- and moisture-driven crack propagation in deforming porous media has achieved increasing interest in recent years, in particular with regard to the modeling of hydraulic fracturing, the so-called "fracking". Here, the challenge is to link at least three modeling ingredients for (i) the behavior of the solid skeleton and fluid bulk phases and their interaction, (ii) the crack propagation on not a priori known paths and (iii) the extra fluid flow within developed cracks. To this end, a macroscopic framework is proposed for a continuum phase field modeling of fracture in porous media. It provides a rigorous geometric approach to a diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a constitutive balance equation for a regularized crack surface and its modular linkage to a Darcy-Biot-type bulk response of hydro-poro-elasticity. The approach overcomes difficulties associated with the computational realization of sharp crack discontinuities, in particular when it comes to complex crack topologies including branching. A modular concept is outlined for linking of the diffusive crack modeling with the hydro-poro-elastic response of the porous bulk material. This includes a generalization of crack driving forces from energetic definitions towards threshold-based criteria in terms of the effective stress related to the solid skeleton of a fluid-saturated porous medium. Furthermore, a Poiseuille-type constitutive continuum modeling of the extra fluid flow in developed cracks is suggested based on a deformation-dependent permeability, that is scaled by a characteristic length. This proposed modular model structure is exploited in the numerical implementation by constructing a robust finite element method, based on an algorithmic decoupling of updates for the crack phase field and the state variables of the hydro-poro-elastic bulk response. We demonstrate the performance of the phase field formulation of fracture for a spectrum of model problems of hydraulic fracture. A slight modification of the framework allows the simulation of drying-caused crack patterns in partially saturated capillar-porous media.},

abstract = {In this paper we complete the analysis of the flow of a Bingham fluid along a wavy-walled channel. We confirm numerically the results of [I. Frigaard, D. Ryan, Flow of a visco-plastic fluid in a channel of slowly varying width, J. Non-Newt. Fluid Mech. 123 (2004) 67-83], that there is a true rigid plug for a sufficiently small amplitude long wavelength perturbation of the uniform plane channel. For larger amplitude width perturbations the plug breaks and we provide a comparison between analytical estimates for the breaking amplitude and numerical computations using the augmented Lagrangian method. Plug breaking arises due to the creation of significant extensional stresses within the unyielded part of the fluid. When the plug breaks the extensional stresses govern the structure of the flow within the pseudo-plug. We provide a complete asymptotic solution for the flow in this situation, and compare against numerical computations. In the second part of the paper, we study the efficacity of viscosity regularisation methods for computing this type of flow. We show that accurate resolution of yield surface positions requires proper control of the numerical residuals and having a favourable ratio of regularisation error to critical strain rate. We show that failure to manage these errors means that regularisation methods can produce completely erroneous predictions of the yield surfaces, e.g. predicting broken plug regions when they are in fact intact. For general lubrication-type flows one does not have an estimate of these errors. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Transition from laminar to turbulent flow drastically changes the mixing, transport, and drag properties of fluids, yet when and how turbulence emerges is elusive even for simple flow within pipes and rectangular channels. Unlike the onset of temporal disorder, which is identified as the universal route to chaos in confined flows, characterization of the onset of spatio-temporal disorder has been an outstanding challenge because turbulent domains irregularly decay or spread as they propagate downstream. Here, through extensive experimental investigation of channel flow, we identify a distinctive transition with critical behavior. Turbulent domains continuously injected from an inlet ultimately decayed, or in contrast, spread depending on flow rates. Near a transition point, critical behavior was observed. We investigate both spatial and temporal dynamics of turbulent clusters, measuring four critical exponents, a universal scaling function and a scaling relation, all in agreement with the (2+1)-dimensional directed percolation universality class.},

The last extension is made by transposing the way the chain-chain interactions are mathematically expressed in the reptation theory to suspensions. The particle-particle interactions are regarded as a confinement to cages formed by surrounding particles and by introducing a new dissipative motion (an analog of the reptation motion) inside the cages. Nonlinear responses to imposed shear and elongational flows are found to be in qualitative agreement with available experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE {\&}{\#}13; Most current Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately 10 years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs.{\&}{\#}13; {\&}{\#}13; Approach:{\&}{\#}13; We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons.{\&}{\#}13; {\&}{\#}13; Main results:{\&}{\#}13; We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers.{\&}{\#}13; Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods.{\&}{\#}13; Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods.{\&}{\#}13; {\&}{\#}13; Significance:{\&}{\#}13; This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines on when and how to use them. It also identifies a number of challenges to further advance EEG classification in BCI.},

abstract = {The conceptual problems arising in the definition and measurement of temperature in non-equilibrium states are discussed in this paper in situations where the local-equilibrium hypothesis is no longer satisfactory. This is a necessary and urgent discussion because of the increasing interest in thermodynamic theories beyond local equilibrium, in computer simulations, in non-linear statistical mechanics, in new experiments, and in technological applications of nanoscale systems and material sciences. First, we briefly review the concept of temperature from the perspectives of equilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Afterwards, we explore which of the equilibrium concepts may be extrapolated beyond local equilibrium and which of them should be modified, then we review several attempts to define temperature in non-equilibrium situations from macroscopic and microscopic bases. A wide review of proposals is offered on effective non-equilibrium temperatures and their application to ideal and real gases, electromagnetic radiation, nuclear collisions, granular systems, glasses, sheared fluids, amorphous semiconductors and turbulent fluids. The consistency between the different relativistic transformation laws for temperature is discussed in the new light gained from this perspective. A wide bibliography is provided in order to foster further research in this field.},

abstract = {Large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) is used as a tool to probe the nonlinear rheological response of a model elasto-viscoplastic material (a Carbopol microgel). In contrast to most recent studies, these large amplitude measurements are carried out in a stress-controlled manner. We outline a descriptive framework of characterization measures for nonlinear rheology under stress-controlled LAOS, and this is contrasted experimentally to the strain-controlled framework that is more commonly used. We show that this stress-controlled methodology allows for a physically intuitive interpretation of the yielding behavior of elasto-viscoplastic materials. The insight gained into the material behavior through these nonlinear measures is then used to develop two constitutive models that prescribe the rheological response of the Carbopol microgel. We show that these two successively more sophisticated constitutive models, which are based on the idea of strain decomposition, capture in a compact manner the important features of the nonlinear rheology of the microgel. The second constitutive model, which incorporates the concept of kinematic hardening, embodies all of the essential behaviors exhibited by Carbopol. These include elasto-viscoplastic creep and time-dependent viscosity plateaus below a critical stress, a viscosity bifurcation at the critical stress, and Herschel–Bulkley flow behavior at large stresses.},

abstract = {The assumption that matter charges and currents could generate fields, which are called, in analogy with electromagnetism, gravitoeletric and gravitomagnetic fields, dating from the origins of General Relativity (GR). On the other hand, the Teleparallel Equivalent of GR (TEGR), as a gauge theory, seems to be the ideal scenario to define these fields, based on the gauge field strength components. The purpose of the present work is to investigate the nature of the gravitational electric and magnetic fields in the context of the TEGR, where the tetrad formalism on which it is based seems more suited to deal with phenomena related to observers. As its applications, we have studied the gravito-electromagnetic fields for the Schwarzschild solution and for the geometry produced by a spherical rotating shell in slow motion and weak field regime. The expressions obtained, at the linear regime, are very similar to those of electromagnetism.},

In the same year, numerical simulations for the matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments became first available, providing constraints on the shear viscosity in QCD. The field has come a long way since then. We present the current status of the theory of non-equilibrium fluid dynamics in 2017, including the divergence of the fluid dynamic gradient expansion, resurgence, non-equilibrium attractor solutions, the inclusion of thermal fluctuations as well as their relation to microscopic theories. Furthermore, we review the theory basis for numerical fluid dynamics simulations of relativistic nuclear collisions, and comparison of modern simulations to experimental data for nucleus-nucleus, nucleus-proton and proton-proton collisions.},

However, the physical nature of the field has not been identified. Here, the granular fluidity is found to be a kinematic variable given by the velocity fluctuation and packing fraction. This is verified with many discrete element simulations, which show the operational fluidity definition, solutions of the fluidity model, and the proposed microscopic formula all agree.

abstract = {Hill [Hill R. The mathematical theory of plasticity. Oxford: Clarendon Press; 1950] demonstrated that "infinitesimal-displacement theory, used in classical elastoplasticity, may no longer be valid in elastic-plastic analysis because the convected terms in the rate of change of the stress acting on material particle may then not be negligible" [Lee EH. Some anomalies in the structure of elastic-plastic theory at finite strain. In: Carroll MM, Hayes M. editors. Nonlinear effects in fluids and solids, New York: Plenum Press; 1996. p. 227-49]. From this we may deduce that•the elastic deformation part may have considerable influence on the total deformation, even when it is relatively small, i.e. we are confronted with the vital requirement of properly computing elastic deformations.•Further, finite deformation kinematics should be applied, i.e. they should take account of possibly large rotations, e.g. through a formulation in an Eulerian frame. Xiao et al. [Xiao H, Bruhns OT, Meyers ATM. Self-consistent Eulerian rate type elasto-plasticity models based upon the logarithmic stress rate. Int J Plast 1999;15:479-520] gave the mathematical proof, that Bernstein's consistency criterion [Bernstein B. Relation between hypo-elasticity and elasticity. Trans Soc Rheol 1960;4:23-8; Bernstein B. Hypoelasticity and elasticity. Arch Ration Mech Anal 1960;6:90-104] is fulfilled in a hypoelastic law of grade zero if, and only if, the objective logarithmic stress rate [Xiao H, Bruhns OT, Meyers A. Hypo-elasticity model based upon the logarithmic stress rate. J Elasticity 1997;47:51-68] has been applied. This proof is of complicated mathematical nature. Here, we compare several objective Eulerian stress rates of corotational and non-corotational type for the hypoelastic law cited above in closed single parameter deformation cycles. It is found that the logarithmic stress rate returns the element to its stress-free original state after the closed cycle, thus confirming the findings in Xiao et al. (1999). We show that for some other objective rates the errors are accumulating to considerable amounts after several cycles, even when the deformation in investigation is relatively small. Interestingly, for Jaumann stress rate, the error may vanish for specified deformation measures. {\textcopyright} 2006 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with causality of the gradient elasticity models of heterogeneous materials. As a rule, these models are not strictly causal since they allow an infinite speed of energy transfer by means of either propagating or transient evanescent waves. A discussion is presented in this paper of both physical and mathematical implications of this fact. This discussion is carried out employing one-dimensional (1D) second-order gradient models. A phenomenological enhancement is proposed, which makes these models causal. The main idea behind this enhancement is that a partial differential equation that governs dynamic behaviour of a causal gradient elasticity model must be of the same order with respect to spatial coordinate and with respect to time. The validity of this idea is confirmed in this paper by deriving a second-order 1D continuum model for concrete. A brief comparison is provided in conclusion of the equations of motion of the 1D second-gradient elasticity models and those used in dynamics of thin bars. It is shown that the proposed causal model corresponds to the most advanced dynamic models of such bars, namely to the Timoshenko model for the bending motion and the Mindlin model for the longitudinal motion of a bar. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Procedures to define boundary conditions for Navier-Stokes equations are discussed. A new formulation using characteristic wave relations through boundaries is derived for the Euler equations and generalized to the Navier-Stokes equations. The emphasis is on deriving boundary conditions compatible with modern non-dissipative algorithms used for direct simulations of turbulent flows. These methods have very low dispersion errors and require precise boundary conditions to avoid numerical instabilities and to control spurious wave reflections at the computational boundaries. The present formulation is an attempt to provide such conditions. Reflecting and non-reflecting boundary condition treatments are presented. Examples of practical implementations for inlet and outlet boundaries as well as slip and no-slip walls are presented. The method applies to subsonic and supersonic flows. It is compared with a reference method based on extrapolation and partial use of Riemann invariants. Test cases described include a ducted shear layer, vortices propagating through boundaries, and Poiseuille flow. Although no mathematical proof of well-posedness is given, the method uses the correct number of boundary conditions required for well-posedness of the Navier-Stokes equations and the examples reveal that it provides a significant improvement over the reference method.},

This interdisciplinary approach is unique for the treatment of the subject matter, and much of the material is new or newly composed. No other treatise similar in content and composition to this one exists at this time. The authors present a self-contained, finite deformation and finte electro-magnetic field theory from a unified viewpoint, providing ample critical illustrations by way of applications. The constitution of the book is as follows: (1) development of the ten basic balance laws in order to establish the macroscopic electromagnetic theory; (2) establishment of the general constitutive theory. By means of eight axioms, the local nonlinear theory is developed for finite deformations and E-M (electromagnetic) fields. In this way, for the first time, it has been possible to express the nonlinear constitutive equations for the ninety magnetic groups relevant to magnetic crystals. (3) discussion of special theories and applications. Various special topics are explored and solutions presented to several nonlinear problems in order to demonstrate the uses of the basic theory. The book is intended primarily as a guide and reference for researchers, although selected chapters can well be used as a textbook for graduate studies.},

@article{Hamity1969,
abstract = {A generally relativistic theory of thermodynamics is developed, based on four main physical principles: heat is a local form of energy, therefore described by a thermal energy tensor; conservation of mass, equivalent to conservation of heat, or the local first law; entropy is a local current; and non-destruction of entropy, or the local second law. A fluid is defined by the thermostatic energy tensor being isotropic. The entropy current is related to the other fields by certain equations, including a generalised Gibbs equation for the thermostatic entropy, followed by linear and quadratic terms in the dissipative (thermal minus thermostatic) energy tensor. Then the second law suggests certain equations for the dissipative energy tensor, generalising the Israel- Stewart dissipative relations, which describe heat conduction and viscosity including relativistic effects and relaxation effects. In the thermostatic case, the perfect-fluid model is recovered. In the linear approximation for entropy, the Eckart theory is recovered. In the quadratic approximation for entropy, the theory is similar to that of Israel {\&} Stewart, but involving neither state-space differentials, nor a non-equilibrium Gibbs equation, nor non-material frames. Also, unlike conventional thermodynamics, the thermal energy density is not assumed to be purely thermostatic, though this is derived in the linear approximation. Otherwise, the theory reduces in the non- relativistic limit to the extended thermodynamics of irreversible processes due to Mueller. The dissipative energy density seems to be a new thermodynamical field, but also exists in relativistic kinetic theory of gases.},

abstract = {Viscosity regularisation methods are probably the most popular current method for computing visco-plastic fluid flows. They are however generally used in an ad hoc manner. Here we examine convergence of regularised solutions to those of the corresponding exact models, in both mathematical and physical senses. Mathematically, the aim is to give practical guidance as to the order of error that one might expect for different regularisations and for different types of flow. Our theoretical results are illustrated with a number of computed example flows showing the orders of error predicted. Physically, the question is whether or not the regularised solutions behave in the same way as the exact solutions, qualitatively as well as quantitatively. We show that there are flows for which regularisation methods will generate their maximum errors, e.g. lubrication-type flows. In this context, we also consider the effects of regularisation on problems of hydrodynamic stability. For broad classes of problems, stability characteristics of the flow are incorrectly predicted by the use of viscosity regularisation methods. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Finite element modeling and simulation of laser powder bed fusion process (L-PBF) provides physical insight about the laser processing that is often not possible or highly difficult by in-situ monitoring or in-process measurements. A three-dimensional (3D) thermal field especially into depth direction that is not visible by a thermal camera can be obtained by solving the 3D heat transfer problem. Furthermore, microstructure growth can be modelled to predict the direction of solidification in the fabricated part. This paper presents 3D Finite Element Method (FEM) based simulation models developed for laser processing of single- and multi-tracks with different energy density levels dependent upon process parameters such as laser power and scan velocity. This 3D L-PBF process model is validated with in-situ thermal measurements and further improved by utilizing predicted spattering of powder material which is in turn included as a stochastic heat loss in the 3D FEM model. Thermal gradients extracted from these simulations utilized to compute the directions in the resulting solidification which are found to be in reasonable agreements with experimental observations. Finally, a phase field method based post processing is applied on the thermal solution to simulate the nucleation phenomenon and columnar dendrite formation during solidification.},

abstract = {The behaviour of dense assemblies of dry grains submitted to continuous shear deformation has been the subject of many experiments and discrete particle simulations. This paper is a collective work carried out among the French research group Groupement de Recherche Milieux Divis{\'{e}}s (GDR MiDi). It proceeds from the collection of results on steady uniform granular flows obtained by different groups in six different geometries both in experiments and numerical works. The goal is to achieve a coherent presentation of the relevant quantities to be measured i.e. flowing thresholds, kinematic profiles, effective friction, etc. First, a quantitative comparison between data coming from different experiments in the same geometry identifies the robust features in each case. Second, a transverse analysis of the data across the different configurations, allows us to identify the relevant dimensionless parameters, the different flow regimes and to propose simple interpretations. The present work, more than a simple juxtaposition of results, demonstrates the richness of granular flows and underlines the open problem of defining a single rheology. {\textcopyright} EDP Sciences/ Societ{\`{a}} Italiana di Fisica/ Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {The flow of a viscous fluid in a plane channel is simulated numerically following the DNS approach, and using a computational code for the numerical integration of the Navier-Stokes equations implemented on a hybrid CPU/GPU computing architecture (for the meaning of symbols and acronyms used, one can refer to the Nomenclature). Three turbulent-flow databases, each representing the turbulent statistically-steady state of the flow at three different values of the Reynolds number, are built up, and a number of statistical moments of the fluctuating velocity field are computed. For turbulent-flow-structure investigation, the vortex-detection technique of the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalue pair in the velocity-gradient tensor is applied to the fluctuating-velocity fields. As a result, and among other types, hairpin vortical structures are unveiled. The processes of evolution that characterize the hairpin vortices in the near-wall region of the turbulent channel are investigated, in particular at one of the three Reynolds numbers tested, with specific attention given to the relationship that exists between the dynamics of the vortical structures and the occurrence of ejection and sweep quadrant events. Interestingly, it is found that the latter events play a preminent role in the way in which the morphological evolution of a hairpin vortex develops over time, as related in particular to the establishment of symmetric and persistent hairpins. The present results have been obtained from a database that incorporates genuine DNS solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, without superposition of any synthetic structures in the form of initial and/or boundary conditions for the simulations.},

abstract = {This paper presents a parameter-free theory of shear-generated turbulence at asymptotically high$\backslash$nReynolds numbers in incompressible fluids. It is based on a two-fluids concept. Both components are$\backslash$nmaterially identical and inviscid. The first component is an ensemble of quasi-rigid dipole-vortex$\backslash$ntubes (vortex filaments, excitations) as quasi-particles in chaotic motion. The second is a$\backslash$nsuperfluid performing evasive motions between the tubes. The local dipole motions follow Helmholtz'$\backslash$nlaw. The vortex radii scale with the energy-containing length scale. Collisions between$\backslash$nquasi-particles lead either to annihilation (likewise rotation, turbulent dissipation) or to$\backslash$nscattering (counterrotation, turbulent diffusion). There are analogies with birth and death$\backslash$nprocesses of population dynamics and their master equations and with Landau's two-fluid theory of$\backslash$nliquid helium. For free homogeneous decay the theory predicts the turbulent kinetic energy to follow$\backslash$nt −1 .

abstract = {Hierarchical structures with constituents over multiple length scales are found in various natural materials like bones, shells, spider silk and others, all of which display enhanced quasistatic mechanical properties, such as high specific strength, stiffness, and toughness. At the same time, the role of hierarchy on the dynamic behavior of metamaterials remains largely unexplored. This study numerically and experimentally assesses the effect of bioinspired hierarchical organization as well as of viscoelasticity on the wave attenuation properties of continuous elastic metamaterials. We consider single-phase meta-materials formed by self-similar unit cells with different hierarchical levels and types of hierarchy. Two types of structures are considered: a hub-spoke geometry with thin connecting elements and nested hierarchical organization, and a crosslike porous geometry with external hierarchical organization. In the first, hierarchical elements occur at similar size scales, while in the second they differ by one order of magnitude. Results highlight a number of advantages through the introduction of structural hierarchy. Band gaps relative to the corresponding nonhierarchical structures are mostly preserved in both types of structures, but additional hierarchically-induced band gaps also appear, and the hierarchical configuration allows the tuning of band-gap frequencies to lower frequencies in the crosslike porous geometry, with a simultaneous significant reduction of the global structural weight. We show that even small viscoelastic effects are essential in determining the overall attenuation behavior, including between band gaps. Finally, we verify the numerically-predicted multifrequency band gaps by experimental characterization of the transmission properties of crosslike structures. The approach we propose allows the incorporation of hierarchical organization in existing metamaterial configurations, with the corresponding improvement of wave-damping properties, thus extending application possibilities for elastic metamaterials to multiple frequency scales.},

The proposed model, in the linear approximation, can be compared to the well-known equilibrium equations of static linear elasticity. An appropriate kinetic energy is identified, and we present a dynamical model of rotational elasticity. The propagation of elastic waves in such a medium is studied and we find two classes of waves, transversal rotational waves and longitudinal rotational waves, both of which are solutions of the nonlinear partial differential equations. For certain parameter choices, the transversal wave velocity can be greater than the longitudinal wave velocity. Moreover, parameter ranges are identified where the model describes an auxetic material. However, in all cases the potential energy functional is positive definite. Finally, we couple the rotational waves to linear elastic waves to study the behaviour of the coupled system. We find wave-like solutions to the coupled equations and can visualise our results with the help of suitable figures.},

abstract = {Preface This monograph sums up studies performed in developing the relativistic theory of gravity (RTG) and presented in refs. [3, 9, 38, 10, 5, 11, 6, 34, 12, 35, 36, 37, 31, 13]. Detailed references to earlier works, that to a certain extent served as scaffolding in the construction of RTG, are given in the monograph [10], written together with prof. M. A. Mestvirishvili and published in 1989. Therein, also, critical comments are presented concerning general relativity theory (GRT), which still remain in force. In order to facilitate reading in section 14 we provide elements of tensor analysis and Riemannian geometry. As a rule, we make use of the set of units in which G = c = ¯ h = 1. However, in the final expressions we restore the dependence on the constants G, c, ¯ h. Throughout the book, Greek letters assume values 0,1,2,3, while Latin letters assume —1,2,3. The creation of this monograph advanced together with the completion of studies of individual issues, so it inevitably contains recurrences, especially concerning such issues that are important for understanding the essence of both RTG and GRT. The hypothesis underlying RTG asserts that the gravitational field, like all other physical fields, develops in Minkowski space, while the source of this field is the conserved energymomentum tensor of matter, including the gravitational field itself. This approach permits constructing, in a unique manner, the theory of the gravitational field as a gauge theory. Here, there arises an effective Riemannian space, which literally has a field nature. In GRT the space is considered to be Riemannian owing to the presence of matter, so gravity is considered a consequence of space–time exhibiting curvature. The RTG gravitational field has spins 2 and 0 and represents a physical field in the Faraday–Maxwell spirit. The complete set of RTG equations follows directly from the least action principle. Since all physical fields develop in Minkowski space, all 5 fundamental principles of physics — the integral conservation laws of energy–momentum and of angular momentum — are strictly obeyed in RTG. In the theory the Mach principle is realized: an inertial system is determined by the distribution of matter. Unlike GRT, acceleration has an absolute sense. Inertial and gravitational forces are separated, and they differ in their nature. The theory, unlike GRT, provides a unique explanation for all gravitational effects in the Solar system. GRT does not comply with the equivalence principle, does not explain the equality of the inert and active gravitational masses, and gives no unique prediction for gravitational effects. It does not contain the usual conservation laws of energy–momentum and of angular momentum of matter. It should be especially noted that the known postNewtonian approximation do satisfy the equivalence principle, do provide a unique description of gravitational effects in the Solar system, and also establish the equality between the inertial and active gravitational masses. However, it does not follow uniquely from the GRT equations, since its derivation relies on additional assumptions, that do not follow from the theory, i.e. a departure occurs beyond the limits of GRT, which is based on the gravitational field being represented as a physical field, although this is not so in GRT. Therefore, this approximation cannot be considered a unique consequence of the GRT equations. It has rather been guessed, then derived from the theory, while, according to RTG, the post–Newtonian approximation follows uniquely from equations of the theory. Thus, the post–Newtonian approximation, previously applied for the description of gravitational effects follows directly from our theory. RTG introduces essential changes into the character of the development of the Universe and into the collapse of large masses. Analysis of the development of a homogeneous and isotropic Universe within RTG leads to the conclusion that the Universe is infinite, and that it is " flat " . Its development proceeds cycli6},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the treatment of discontinuities in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. In particular we discuss the difference between integral and differential representations of the fluid equations in an SPH context and how this relates to the formulation of dissipative terms for the capture of shocks and other discontinuities. This has important implications for many problems, in particular related to recently highlighted problems in treating Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across entropy gradients in SPH. The specific problems pointed out by Agertz et al. [O. Agertz, B. Moore, J. Stadel, D. Potter, F. Miniati, J. Read, L. Mayer, A. Gawryszczak, A. Kravtsov, ??. Nordlund, F. Pearce, V. Quilis, D.

Walder, Fundamental differences between SPH and grid methods, MNRAS 380 (2007) 963-978] are shown to be related in particular to the (lack of) treatment of contact discontinuities in standard SPH formulations which can be cured by the simple application of an artificial thermal conductivity term. We propose a new formulation of artificial thermal conductivity in SPH which minimises dissipation away from discontinuities and can therefore be applied quite generally in SPH calculations. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

As a remedy, a new algorithm is proposed that combines the homogenization of the particle configuration by a background pressure while at the same time reduces artificial numerical dissipation. The transport or advection velocity of particles is modified and an effective stress term occurs in the momentum balance that accounts for the difference between advection velocity times particle density and actual particle momentum. The present formulation can be applied for internal flows where the density summation is applicable. A wide range of test cases demonstrates unprecedented accuracy and stability of the proposed modification even at previously infeasible conditions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Four sets of nonreactive solute transport experiments were conducted with micromodels. Each set consisted of three experiments with one variable, i.e., flow velocity, grain diameter, pore-aspect ratio, and flow-focusing heterogeneity. The data sets were offered to pore-scale modeling groups to test their numerical simulators. Each set consisted of two learning experiments, for which all results were made available, and one challenge experiment, for which only the experimental description and base input parameters were provided. The experimental results showed a nonlinear dependence of the transverse dispersion coefficient on the Peclet number, a negligible effect of the pore-aspect ratio on transverse mixing, and considerably enhanced mixing due to flow focusing. Five pore-scale models and one continuum-scale model were used to simulate the experiments. Of the pore-scale models, two used a pore-network (PN) method, two others are based on a lattice Boltzmann (LB) approach, and one used a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. The learning experiments were used by the PN models to modify the standard perfect mixing approach in pore bodies into approaches to simulate the observed incomplete mixing. The LB and CFD models used the learning experiments to appropriately discretize the spatial grid representations. For the continuum modeling, the required dispersivity input values were estimated based on published nonlinear relations between transverse dispersion coefficients and Peclet number. Comparisons between experimental and numerical results for the four challenge experiments show that all pore-scale models were all able to satisfactorily simulate the experiments. The continuum model underestimated the required dispersivity values, resulting in reduced dispersion. The PN models were able to complete the simulations in a few minutes, whereas the direct models, which account for the micromodel geometry and underlying flow and transport physics, needed up to several days on supercomputers to resolve the more complex problems.},

abstract = {In this paper we formulate a geometric theory of the mechanics of growing solids. Bulk growth is modeled by a material manifold with an evolving metric. Time dependence of metric represents the evolution of the stress-free (natural) configuration of the body in response to changes in mass density and "shape". We show that time dependency of material metric will affect the energy balance and the entropy production inequality; both the energy balance and the entropy production inequality have to be modified. We then obtain the governing equations covariantly by postulating invariance of energy balance under time-dependent spatial diffeomorphisms. We use the principle of maximum entropy production in deriving an evolution equation for the material metric. In the case of isotropic growth, we find those growth distributions that do not result in residual stresses. We then look at Lagrangian field theory of growing elastic solids. We will use the Lagrange-d'Alembert's principle with Rayleigh's dissipation functions to derive all the governing equations. We make an explicit connection between our geometric theory and the conventional multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradient {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}F{\}}=\backslashmathbf{\{}F{\}}{\_}e\backslashmathbf{\{}F{\}}{\_}g{\$} into growth and elastic parts. We linearize the nonlinear theory and derive a linearized theory of growth mechanics. Finally, we obtain the stress-free growth distributions in the linearized theory.},

abstract = {This paper is dedicated to the identification of constitutive parameters of the Mohr–Coulomb constitutive model from in situ geotechnical measurements. A pressuremeter curve and the horizontal displacements of a sheet pile wall retaining an excavation are successively used as measurements. Two kinds of optimization algorithms are used to minimize the error function, the first one based on a gradient method and the second one based on a genetic algorithm. The efficiency of each algorithm related to the error function topology is discussed. Finally, it is shown that the use of a genetic algorithm to identify the soil parameters seems particularly suitable when the topology of the error function is complex.},

abstract = {We describe a numerical model to simulate the non-linear elasto-plastic dynamics of compressible materials. The model is fully Eulerian and it is discretized on a fixed Cartesian mesh. The hyperelastic constitutive law considered is neohookean and the plasticity model is based on a multiplicative decomposition of the inverse deformation tensor. The model is thermodynamically consistent and it is shown to be stable in the sense that the norm of the deviatoric stress tensor beyond yield is non increasing. The multimaterial integration scheme is based on a simple numerical flux function that keeps the interfaces sharp. Numerical illustrations in one to three space dimensions of high-speed multimaterial impacts in air are presented.},

The viscoplastic material behavior is described by the model introduced by de Souza Mendes and Dutra [30] - herein called SMD fluid - which is essentially a regularized viscosity function that involves only rheological properties of the material. The incompressible balance equations are coupled with the non-linear SMD model and are approximated by a multi-field Galerkin least-squares method in terms of extra-stress, pressure and velocity. The results obtained confirm the stability features of the multi-field formulation and the appropriateness of the rheological stress regularization introduced by the SMD fluid. The influence of inertia and rheological parameters on the morphology of the material yield surfaces is analyzed and discussed. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The assumption that matter charges and currents could generate fields, which are called, by analogy with electromagnetism, gravitoeletric and gravitomagnetic fields, dates from the origins of General Relativity (GR). On the other hand, the Teleparallel Equivalent of GR (TEGR), as a gauge theory, seems to be the ideal scenario to define these fields, based on the gauge field strength components. The purpose of the present work is to investigate the nature of the gravitational electric and magnetic fields in the context of the TEGR, where the tetrad formalism behind it seems to be more appropriated to deal with phenomena related to observers. As our main results, we have obtained, for the first time, the exact expressions for the gravito-electromagnetic fields for the Schwarzschild solution that in the linear approximation become the usual expected ones. To improve our understanding about these fields, we have also studied the geometry produced by a spherical rotating shell in slow motion and weak field regime. Again, the expressions obtained are in complete agreement with those of electromagnetism.},

However, this result is highly questionable, because the adopted Navier-Stokes equations and the first-order velocity-slip boundary condition are first-order (in terms of the Knudsen number) approximations of the Boltzmann equation and the kinetic boundary condition for rarefied gas flows. Our numerical simulations based on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook kinetic equation and regularized 20-moment equations prove that the Navier-Stokes equations with the first-order velocity-slip boundary condition are only accurate at a very small Knudsen number limit, where the apparent gas permeability is a linear function of the Knudsen number.},

abstract = {Accurate modeling of gas microvection is crucial for a lot of MEMS applications (micro- heat exchangers, pressure gauges, fluidic microactuators for active control of aerody- namic flows, mass flow and temperature microsensors, micropumps, and microsystems for mixing or separation for local gas analysis, mass spectrometers, vacuum, and dosing valves{\ldots}). Gas flows in microsystems are often in the slip flow regime, characterized by a moderate rarefaction with a Knudsen number of the order of 10?2–10?1. In this regime, velocity slip and temperature jump at the walls play a major role in heat transfer. This paper presents a state of the art review on convective heat transfer in microchannels, focusing on rarefaction effects in the slip flow regime. Analytical and numerical models are compared for various microchannel geometries and heat transfer conditions (con- stant heat flux or constant wall temperature). The validity of simplifying assumptions is detailed and the role played by the kind of velocity slip and temperature jump boundary conditions is shown. The influence of specific effects, such as viscous dissipation, axial conduction and variable fluid properties is also discussed.},

abstract = {We review the traditional derivation of the fluid-dynamical equations from kinetic theory according to Israel and Stewart. We show that their procedure to close the fluid-dynamical equations of motion is not unique. Their approach contains two approximations, the first being the so-called 14-moment approximation to truncate the single-particle distribution function. The second consists in the choice of equations of motion for the dissipative currents. Israel and Stewart used the second moment of the Boltzmann equation, but this is not the only possible choice. In fact, there are infinitely many moments of the Boltzmann equation which can serve as equations of motion for the dissipative currents. All resulting equations of motion have the same form, but the transport coefficients are different in each case.},

abstract = {One major drawback of the eddy viscosity subgrid-scale stress models used in large-eddy simulations is their inability to represent correctly with a single universal constant different turbulent field in rotating or sheared flows, near solid walls, or in transitional regimes. In the present work, a new eddy viscosity model is presented which alleviates many of these drawbacks. The model coefficient is computed dynamically as the calculation progresses rather than input a priori. The model is based on an algebraic identity (Germano 1990) between the subgrid-scale stresses at two different filtered levels and the resolved turbulent stresses. The subgrid-scale stresses obtained using the proposed model vanish in laminar flow and at a solid boundary, and have the correct asymptotic behavior in the near-wall region of a turbulent boundary layer. The results of large-eddy simulations of transitional and turbulent channel flow that use the proposed model are in good agreement with the direct simulation data.},

This raises questions about the objectivity of the second law: does it depend, for example, on what we know about the system? For over a century, much effort has been devoted to incorporating information into thermodynamics and assessing the entropic and energetic costs of manipulating information. More recently, this historically theoretical pursuit has become relevant in practical situations where information is manipulated at small scales, such as in molecular and cell biology, artificial nano-devices or quantum computation. Here we give an introduction to a novel theoretical framework for the thermodynamics of information based on stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems, review some recent experimental results, and present an overview of the state of the art in the field.},

This term is a little bit similar to Weylean one in the Weyl curvature tensor. There has been attempted to find a curvature measure in the combined (tensor plus pseudotensor) tensors space.

abstract = {This work presents the first application of a non-intrusive reduced order method to model solid interacting with compressible fluid flows to simulate crack initiation and propagation. In the high fidelity model, the coupling process is achieved by introducing a source term into the momentum equation, which represents the effects of forces of the solid on the fluid. A combined single and smeared crack model with the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is used to simulate crack initiation and propagation. The non-intrusive reduced order method is then applied to compressible fluid and fractured solid coupled modelling where the computational cost involved in the full high fidelity simulation is high. The non-intrusive reduced order model (NIROM) developed here is constructed through proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and a radial basis function (RBF) multi-dimensional interpolation method. The performance of the NIROM for solid interacting with compressible fluid flows, in the presence of fracture models, is illustrated by two complex test cases: an immersed wall in a fluid and a blasting test case. The numerical simulation results show that the NIROM is capable of capturing the details of compressible fluids and fractured solids while the CPU time is reduced by several orders of magnitude. In addition, the issue of whether or not to subtract the mean from the snapshots before applying POD is discussed in this paper. It is shown that solutions of the NIROM, without mean subtracted before constructing the POD basis, captured more details than the NIROM with mean subtracted from snapshots.},

The metric {\$}g{\$} satisfies Einstein equations. Since the 1970s many authors have tried to generalize this geometrical model of the physical space-time by introducing torsion and even more general metric-affine geometry. In this paper we discuss status of torsion in the theory of gravity. At first, we emphasize that up to now we have no experimental evidence for the existence of torsion in Nature. Contrary, the all experiments performed in weak gravitational field (Solar System) or in strong regime (binary pulsars) and tests of the Einstein Equivalence Principle ({\{}$\backslash$bf EEP{\}}) confirmed {\{}$\backslash$bf GR{\}} and Lorentzian manifold {\$}(M{\_}4;g){\$} as correct geometrical model of the physical space-time. Then, we give theoretical arguments against introducing of torsion into geometrical model of the physical space-time. At last, we conclude that the general-relativistic model of the physical space-time is sufficient and it seems to be the most satisfactory.},

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

abstract = {A review of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity is presented. It is emphasized that general relativity may be formulated in terms of the tetrad fields and of the torsion tensor, and that this geometrical formulation leads to alternative insights into the theory. The equivalence with the standard formulation in terms of the metric and curvature tensors takes place at the level of field equations. The review starts with a brief account of the history of teleparallel theories of gravity. Then the ordinary interpretation of the tetrad fields as reference frames adapted to arbitrary observers in space-time is discussed, and the tensor of inertial accelerations on frames is obtained. It is shown that the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian field equations allow to define the energy, momentum and angular momentum of the gravitational field, as surface integrals of the field quantities. In the phase space of the theory, these quantities satisfy the algebra of the Poincar$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}} group.},

abstract = {We consider the interpretation of tetrad fields as reference frames in spacetime. Reference frames may be characterized by an antisymmetric acceleration tensor, whose components are identified as the inertial accelerations of the frame (the translational acceleration and the frequency of rotation of the frame). This tensor is closely related to gravitoelectromagnetic field quantities. We construct a set of tetrad fields adapted to observers that are in free fall in the Schwarzschild spacetime, and show that the gravitational energy–momentum constructed out of this set of tetrad fields, in the framework of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity, vanishes. This result is in agreement with the principle of equivalence, and may be taken as a condition for a viable definition of gravitational energy.},

A kinematical-geometrical principle is adopted to determine internal rotating degrees of freedom of turbulent media generated by the eddy structure of turbulent flow fields. The connection between the formulated mechanics and some models (as K-model), widely used in practical engineering flow calculations, is established. As an example, the formulated mechanics is applied to describe some classical flow patterns.},

@article{Jimenez2020,
abstract = {The geometrical formulation of gravity is not unique and can be set up in a variety of spacetimes. Even though the gravitational sector enjoys this freedom of different geometrical interpretations, consistent matter couplings have to be assured for a steady foundation of gravity. In generalised geometries, further ambiguities arise in the matter couplings unless the minimal coupling principle (MCP) is adopted that is compatible with the principles of relativity, universality and inertia. In this work, MCP is applied to all Standard Model gauge fields and matter fields in a completely general (linear) affine geometry. This is also discussed from an effective field theory perspective. It is found that the presence of torsion generically leads to theoretical problems. However, symmetric teleparallelism, wherein the affine geometry is integrable and torsion-free, is consistent with MCP. The generalised Bianchi identity is derived and shown to determine the dynamics of the connection in a unified fashion. Also, the parallel transport with respect to a teleparallel connection is shown to be free of second clock effects.},

@article{Fambri2016,
abstract = {This paper presents an arbitrary h.o. accurate ADER DG method on space-time adaptive meshes (AMR) for the solution of two important families of non-linear time dependent PDE for compr. dissipative flows: the compr. Navier-Stokes equations and the equations of visc. and res. MHD in 2 and 3 space-dimensions. The work continues a recent series of papers concerning the development and application of a proper a posteriori subcell FV limiting procedure suitable for DG methods. It is a well known fact that a major weakness of h.o. DG methods lies in the difficulty of limiting discontinuous solutions, which generate spurious oscillations, namely the so-called 'Gibbs phenomenon'. In the present work the main benefits of the MOOD paradigm, i.e. the computational robustness even in the presence of strong shocks, are preserved and the numerical diffusion is considerably reduced also for the limited cells by resorting to a proper sub-grid. An important feature of our new scheme is its ability to cure even floating point errors that may occur during a simulation, for example when taking real roots of negative numbers or after divisions by zero. We apply the whole approach for the first time to the equations of compr. gas dynamics and MHD in the presence of viscosity, thermal conductivity and magnetic resistivity, therefore extending our family of adaptive ADER-DG schemes to cases for which the numerical fluxes also depend on the gradient of the state vector. The distinguished high-resolution properties of the presented numerical scheme stands out against a wide number of non-trivial test cases both for the compr. Navier-Stokes and the viscous and resistive MHD equations. The present results show clearly that the shock-capturing capability of the news schemes are significantly enhanced within a cell-by-cell Adaptive Mesh Refinement implementation together with time accurate local time stepping (LTS).},

Classical equations have either restricted hyperbol-icity regions like Grad's moment equations or fail to include higher moments in a practical way like the entropy maximization approach. The new closure is based on Pearson-Type-IV distributions which reduce to Maxwellians in equilibrium, but allow anisotropies and skewness in non-equilibrium. The closure relations are essentially explicit and easy to evaluate. Hyperbolicity is shown numerically for a large range of values. Numerical solutions of Riemann problems demonstrate the capability of the new equations to handle strong non-equilibrium.},

abstract = {We present a finite volume Lagrangian discretization of the continuum equations of hydrodynamics through the Voronoi tessellation. We then show that a slight modification of these discrete equations satisfies the first and second laws of thermodynamics. This is done by casting the model into the GENERIC structure. The GENERIC structure ensures thermodynamic consistency and allows for the introduction of correct thermal fluctuations in simple terms. In this way, we obtain a consistent discrete model for Lagrangian fluctuating hydrodynamics. Simulation results are presented that show the validity of the model for simulating hydrodynamic problems at mesoscopic scales.},

@incollection{Groth2006,
abstract = {A new, high-order, conservative, and efficient method for conservation laws on unstructured grids is developed. The concept of discontinuous and high-order local representations to achieve conservation and high accuracy is utilized in a manner similar to the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)[1] and the Spectral Volume (SV)[2] methods, but while these methods are based on the integrated forms of the equations, the new method is based on the differential form to attain a simpler formulation and higher efficiency. Conventional unstructured finite-difference (FD)[3] and finite-volume (FV)[4] methods require data reconstruction based on the least-squares formulation using neighboring point or cell data. Since each unknown employs a different stencil, one must repeat the least-squares inversion for every point or cell at each time step, or store the inversion coefficients. In a high-order, three-dimensional computation, the former would involve impractically large CPU time, while for the latter the memory requirement becomes prohibitive. In addition, the finite-difference method does not satisfy the integral conservation in general. By contrast, the DG and SV methods employ a local, universal reconstruction of a given order of accuracy in each cell in terms of internally defined conservative unknowns. Since the solution is discontinuous across cell boundaries, a Riemann solver is necessary to evaluate boundary flux terms and maintain conservation. In the DG method, a Galerkin finite-element method is employed to update the nodal unknowns within each cell. This requires the inversion of a mass matrix, and the use of quadratures of twice the order of accuracy of the reconstruction to evaluate the surface integrals and additional volume integrals for non-linear flux functions. In the SV method, the integral conservation law is used to update volume averages over subcells defined by a geometrically similar partition of each grid cell. As the order of accuracy increases, the partitioning for 3D requires the introduction of a large number of parameters, whose optimization to achieve convergence becomes increasingly more difficult. Also, the number of interior facets required to subdivide non-planar faces, and the additional increase in the number of quadrature points for each facet, increases the computational cost greatly. In the spectral difference (SD) method, the conservative unknowns in each cell are the number of nodal values required to support a reconstruction of a given order of accuracy. Their locations are chosen so that a quadrature approximation for the volume integral exists at least to the same order of accuracy. The fluxes are calculated at a different set of nodes, whose number will support a reconstruction of one order higher accuracy, since the flux derivatives are used to update the conservative unknowns. They are located so that quadrature approximations for surface integrals over the cell boundaries exist to a required order of accuracy. In addition, the locations of the conservative nodes and the flux nodes must be such that the integral conservation law is satisfied for the cell to the desired order of accuracy. If the nodes are distributed in a geometrically similar manner for all cells, the discretizations become universal, and can be expressed as the same weighted sums of the products of the local metrics and fluxes. These metrics are constants for the line, triangle, and tetrahedron elements, and can be computed analytically for curved elements. We can also show that the number of flux nodes is far less than the number of quadrature points in the SV method. Since all unknowns are decoupled, no mass matrix inversion is required. The SD formulation for the line element is a generalization of the multidomain spectral method[5]. Its tensor products can be used for quadrilateral and hexahedral elements.},

abstract = {Despite a wealth of experimental studies focused on determining and improving mechanical properties and development of fundamental understanding of underlying mechanisms behind nucleation and growth of ductile phase precipitates from melt in glassy matrix, still, there is dearth of knowledge about how these ductile phases nucleate during solidification. Various efforts have been made to address this problem such as experiments in microgravity, high resolution electron microscopy and observation in synchrotron light after levitation but none have proved out to be satisfactory. In this study, an effort has been made to address this problem by modelling and simulation. Current state of the art of development, manufacturing, characterisation and modelling and simulation of bulk metallic glass matrix composites is described in detail. Evolution of microstructure in bulk metallic glass matrix composites during solidification in additive manufacturing has been presented with the aim to address fundamental problem of evolution of solidification microstructure as a result of solute partitioning, diffusion and capillary action. An overview is also presented to explain the relation of microstructure evolution to hardness and fracture toughness. This is aimed at overcoming fundamental problem of lack of ductility and toughness in this diverse class of materials. Quantitative prediction of solidification microstructure is done with the help of advanced part scale modelling and simulation techniques. It has been systematically proposed that 2-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) method combined with finite element (for thermal modelling) tools (CA-FE) programmed on FORTRAN{\`{O}} and parallel simulated on ABAQUS{\`{O}} would best be able to describe this complicated multiphysics phenomenon in most efficient way. Focus is laid on quantification of methodology by which modelling and simulation can be adopted and applied to describe evolution of microstructure in this important class of materials. It is found that proposed methodology is meritorious.},

abstract = {A Lagrangian finite-volume Godunov scheme is extended to simulate two-dimensional solids in planar geometry. The scheme employs an elastic–perfectly plastic material model, implemented using the method of radial return, and either the ‘stiffened' gas or Osborne equation of state to describe the material. The problem of mesh entanglement, common to conventional two-dimensional Lagrangian schemes, is avoided by utilising the free-Lagrange Method. The Lagrangian formulation enables features convecting at the local velocity, such as material interfaces, to be resolved with minimal numerical dissipation. The governing equations are split into separate subproblems and solved sequentially in time using a time-operator split procedure. Local Riemann problems are solved using a two-shock approximate Riemann solver, and piecewise-linear data reconstruction is employed using a MUSCL-based approach to improve spatial accuracy. To illustrate the effectiveness of the technique, numerical simulations are presented and compared with results from commercial fixed-connectivity Lagrangian and smooth particle hydrodynamics solvers (AUTODYN-2D). The simulations comprise the low-velocity impact of an aluminium projectile on a semi-infinite target, the collapse of a thick-walled beryllium cylinder, and the high-velocity impact of cylindrical aluminium and steel projectiles on a thin aluminium target. The analytical solution for the collapse of a thick-walled cylinder is also presented for comparison.},

We also argue that these theories appear to have extra degrees of freedom with respect to general relativity. The usual teleparallel Lagrangian, which has been extensively studied and leads to a theory dynamically equivalent to general relativity, is an exception. Both of these facts appear to have been overlooked in the recent literature on f(T) gravity, but are crucial for assessing the viability of these theories as alternative explanations for the acceleration of the universe.},

In particular, within the Cosserat model the structured material point is rigid and can only experience microrotations, which is also known as micropolar elasticity. We present the geometrically nonlinear theory taking into account all possible interaction terms between the elastic and microelastic structures. This is achieved by considering the irreducible pieces of the deformation gradient and of the dislocation curvature tensor. In addition we also consider the so-called Cosserat coupling term. In this setting we seek soliton type solutions assuming small elastic displacements, however, we allow the material points to experience full rotations which are not assumed to be small. By choosing a particular ansatz we are able to reduce the system of equations to a sine-Gordon type equation which is known to have soliton solutions.},

The model shows that the morphology of the embedded interface is modified by the internal diffusion fluxes as well as by the external flow, and in return, the deformation of the interface changes the behavior of diffusion that may deviate from the Fickean mass transport.

This paper evaluates the role of the phase field method in predicting the microstructure evolution of irradiated nuclear materials and the impact on their mechanical, thermal, and magnetic properties. The paper starts with an overview of the important physical mechanisms of defect evolution and the significant gaps in simulating microstructure evolution in irradiated nuclear materials. Then, the phase field method is introduced as a powerful and predictive tool and its applications to microstructure and property evolution in irradiated nuclear materials are reviewed. The review shows that (1) Phase field models can correctly describe important phenomena such as spatial-dependent generation, migration, and recombination of defects, radiation-induced dissolution, the Soret effect, strong interfacial energy anisotropy, and elastic interaction; (2) The phase field method can qualitatively and quantitatively simulate two-dimensional and three-dimensional microstructure evolution, including radiation-induced segregation, second phase nucleation, void migration, void and gas bubble superlattice formation, interstitial loop evolution, hydrate formation, and grain growth, and (3) The Phase field method correctly predicts the relationships between microstructures and properties. The final section is dedicated to a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the phase field method, as applied to irradiation effects in nuclear materials.},

We demonstrate that in the covariant formulation the preferred method are the Noether charges that are true invariant quantities. The Noether charges depend on the vector field {\$}\backslashxi{\$} and we consider two different options where {\$}\backslashxi{\$} is chosen as either a Killing vector or a four-velocity of the observer. We discuss the physical meaning of each choice on the example of the Schwarzschild solution in different frames: static, freely falling Lemaitre frame, and a newly obtained generalised freely falling frame with an arbitrary initial velocity. We also demonstrate how to determine the inertial spin connection for various tetrads used in our calculations, and find a certain ambiguity in the "switching off" gravity method where different tetrads can share the same inertial spin connection.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an overview of some recent results on applications of knot theory in fluid mechanics, as part of a new discipline called 'topological fluid mechanics' (TFM). The choice of the topics covered here is deliberately restricted to those areas that involve mainly a combination of ideal fluid mechanics techniques and knot theory concepts, complemented with a brief description of some other concepts that have important applications in fluid systems. We begin with the concept of topological equivalence of fluid flow maps, giving a definition of knotted and linked flux-tubes. In the fluid mechanics context Reidemeister's moves are interpreted in terms of local actions of fluid flows performed on fluid structures. An old theorem of Lichtenstein (1925) concerning the isotopic evolution of vortex structures in the context of the Euler equations is re-proposed and discussed in the TFM context for the first time. Then, we review the relationship between helicity and linking numbers and we present some recent results on magnetic relaxation of linked, knotted and braided structures in magnetohydrodynamics. In the context of the Euler equations (and under certain approximations given by the so-called 'localized induction' for vortex structures) we briefly examine some interesting relationships between integrability and existence and stability of vortex filaments in the shape of torus knots. We conclude with an overview of some new results concerning electrically charged knots embedded in a viscous fluid, elastic relaxation of strings and braids and relationships between energy levels and topological information. Some simple bounds on elastic energy levels given by global geometric quantities and topological quantities are presented and discussed for the first time.},

abstract = {A novel computational methodology is presented for the numerical analysis of fast transient dynamics phenomena in large deformations. The new mixed formulation can be written in the form of a system of first order conservation laws, where the linear momentum, the deformation gradient tensor and the total energy of the system are used as main conservation variables, leading to identical convergence patterns for both displacements and stresses. A cell centred Finite Volume Method is utilised to carry out the spatial discretisation. Naturally, discontinuity of the conservation variables across control volume interfaces leads to a Riemann problem, whose approximate solution is derived. A suitable numerical interface flux is evaluated by means of the Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions. We take advantage of the conservative formulation to introduce a Total Variation Diminishing shock capturing technique to improve dramatically the performance of the algorithm in the vicinity of sharp solution gradients. A series of numerical examples will be presented in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the scheme. The new formulation is proven to be very efficient in nearly incompressible and bending dominated scenarios in comparison with classical finite element displacement-based approaches. The proposed numerical framework provides a good balance between accuracy and speed of computation.},

abstract = {The original Well-Balanced (WB) framework of Greenberg and LeRoux (1996) [24] and Gosse (2002) [18] relying on Non-Conservative (NC) products (see LeFoch and Tzavaras (1999) [41]) is set up in order to efficiently treat the so-called Cattaneo model of chemotaxis in 1D (see Hillen and Stevens (2000) [29]). It proceeds by concentrating the source terms onto Dirac masses: this allows to handle them by NC jump relations based on steady-state equations which can be integrated explicitly. A Riemann solver is deduced and the corresponding WB Godunov scheme completed with the standard Hoff-Smoller theory (see Hillen and Stevens (2000) [29]) for the diffusion-reaction equation ruling the evolution of the chemoattractant concentration is studied in detail. Later, following former results of Gosse and Toscani (2002, 2003) [21,22], a simple rewriting of the NC jump relations allows to generate another version of the same Godunov scheme which is well adapted to the parabolic scaling involving a small parameter $\epsilon$. The standard BV framework is used to study the uniform stability of this Asymptotic-Preserving (AP) scheme with respect to $\epsilon$ allows to pass to the limit and derive a simple centered discretization of the Keller-Segel model. Finally, results by Filbet (2006) [14] permit to pass to the complementary limit when the space-step h is sent to zero. Numerical results are included to illustrate the feasibility and the efficiency of the method. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {For two-dimensional topological insulators, the integer and intrinsic (without external magnetic field) quantum Hall effect is described by the gauge anomalous (2+1)-dimensional [2+1d] Chern-Simons (CS) response for the background gauge potential of the electromagnetic U(1) field. The Hall conductance is given by the quantized prefactor of the CS term, which is a momentum-space topological invariant. Here, we show that three-dimensional crystalline topological insulators with no other symmetries are described by a topological (3+1)-dimensional [3+1d] mixed CS term. In addition to the electromagnetic U(1) gauge field, this term contains elasticity tetrad fields {\$}E{\^{}}{\{}\backslash a{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashmu{\}}({\{}\backslashbf r{\}},t) = \backslashpartial{\_}{\{}\backslashmu{\}}X{\^{}}a(\backslashmathbf{\{}r{\}},t){\$} which are gradients of crystalline U(1) phase fields {\$}X{\^{}}a(\backslashmathbf{\{}r{\}},t){\$} and describe the deformations of the crystal. For a crystal in three spatial dimensions {\$}a=1,2,3{\$} and the mixed axial-gravitational response contains three parameters protected by crystalline symmetries: the weak momentum-space topological invariants. The response of the Hall conductance to the deformations of the crystal is quantized in terms of these invariants. In the presence of dislocations, the anomalous 3+1d CS term describes the Callan-Harvey anomaly inflow mechanism. The response can be extended to all odd spatial dimensions. The elasticity tetrads, being the gradients of the lattice U(1) fields, have canonical dimension of inverse length. Similarly, if such tetrad fields enter general relativity, the metric becomes dimensionful, but the physical parameters, such as Newton's constant, the cosmological constant, and masses of particles, become dimensionless.},

The model involves: (i) acoustic and convective transport; (ii) surface tension effects introduced as an extension of the CSF method (Brackbill et al.) to compressible flows; (iii) viscous effects. The interfaces are considered as diffused zones. Every point of the flow is correctly described thanks to a mixture equation of state based on energy conservation and pressure equilibrium. The model is thus valid in each pure fluid as well as at interfaces. A Godunov type method, that enables interface capturing, is developed and used whatever the mesh point. Numerical tests are performed over a wide range of physical situations involving surface tension, compressibility, gravity, viscosity and large density ratios. Tests involving break-up and coalescence are considered to show the ability of the method to deal with dynamic appearance and disappearance of interfaces in an Eulerian framework. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The Hamiltonian viewpoint of fluid mechanical systems with few and infinite number of degrees of freedom is described. Rudimentary concepts of finite-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian dynamics are reviewed, in the context of the passive advection of a scalar or tracer field by a fluid. The notions of integrability, invariant-tori, chaos, overlap criteria, and invariant-tori breakup are described in this context. Preparatory to the introduction of field theories, systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, elements of functional calculus and action principles of mechanics are reviewed. The action principle for the ideal compressible fluid is described in terms of Lagrangian or material variables. Hamiltonian systems in terms of noncanonical variables are presented, including several examples of Eulerian or inviscid fluid dynamics. Lie group theory sufficient for the treatment of reduction is reviewed. The reduction from Lagrangian to Eulerian variables is treated along with Clebsch variable decompositions. Stability in the canonical and noncanonical Hamiltonian contexts is described. Sufficient conditions for stability, such as Rayleigh-like criteria, are seen to be only sufficient in the general case because of the existence of negative-energy modes, which are possessed by interesting fluid equilibria. Linearly stable equilibria with negative energy modes are argued to be unstable when nonlinearity or dissipation is added. The energy-Casimir method is discussed and a variant of it that depends upon the notion of dynamical accessibility is described. The energy content of a perturbation about a general fluid equilibrium is calculated using three methods.},

abstract = {Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a unique numerical method widely used for astrophysical problems since it involves no spatial grid. Rather, fluid quantities are carried by a set of Lagrangian `particles' which move with the flow, meaning that complicated dynamics and asymmetric phenomena are treated with ease. Since adaptivity is a built-in feature of the method there is no need to resort to complicated additional mesh refinement procedures. In this chapter we have undertaken a thorough review of the SPH method in order to develop a sufficiently accurate method which can be applied to MHD problems (Chapters 4-5). The review contains several results which have not been published elsewhere.},

The former is an extension of general relativity and refers to four-dimensional space–time, while we introduce the latter as a description of the equilibrium state of a three-dimensional continuum. Despite these important differences, an analogy is built on their common geometrical foundations, and it is shown that a space–time with curvature and torsion can be considered as a state of a four-dimensional continuum containing defects. This formal analogy is useful for illustrating the geometrical concept of torsion by applying it to concrete physical problems. Moreover, the presentation of these theories using a common geometrical basis allows a deeper understanding of their foundations.},

In physical terms, it represents the degree of linkage of the vortex lines of a flow, conserved when conditions are such that these vortex lines are frozen in the fluid. Some basic properties of helicity are reviewed, with particular reference to (i) its crucial role in the dynamo excitation of magnetic fields in cosmic systems; (ii) its bearing on the existence of Euler flows of arbitrarily complex streamline topology; (iii) the constraining role of the analogous magnetic helicity in the determination of stable knotted minimum-energy magnetostatic structures; and (iv) its role in depleting nonlinearity in the Navier-Stokes equations, with implications for the coherent structures and energy cascade of turbulence. In a final section, some singular phenomena in low Reynolds number flows are briefly described.},

abstract = {Concepts from Finsler differential geometry are applied toward a theory of deformable continua with microstructure. The general model accounts for finite strains, nonlinear elasticity, and various kinds of structural defects in a solid body. The general kinematic structure of the theory includes macroscopic and microscopic displacement fields (i.e., a multiscale theory) whereby the latter are represented mathematically by the director vector of pseudo-Finsler space, not necessarily of unit magnitude. Variational methods are applied to derive Euler-Lagrange equations for static equilibrium and Neumann boundary conditions. The theory is specialized in turn to physical problems of tensile fracture, shear localization, and cavitation in solid bodies. The pseudo-Finsler approach is demonstrated to be more general than classical approaches and can reproduce phase field solutions when certain simplifying assumptions are imposed. Upon invoking a conformal or Weyl-type transformation of the fundamental tensor, analytical and numerical solutions of representative example problems offer new physical insight into coupling of microscopic dilatation with fracture or slip.},

Three different definitions of the rate of inelastic deformation are analysed. One of them defines the rate of inelastic deformation by the nonlinear kinetics of Maxwell relaxation model. The other one is based on the introducing the stress diffusion. The third one assumes that the rate of inelastic deformation is proportional to the vector of density of defects of structure. This vector is managed by a conservation law in which the flux of defects of structure is combined with another balance law. In this connection the field of defects of struc-ture can exchange by an energy with the stress field and generate stress waves, but the total energy is not changed in such a process. Thermodynamical properties and symmetric form of governing equations are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview and introduction to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics in theory and in practice. Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In doing so, we also critique several `urban myths' regarding SPH, in particular the idea that one can simply increase the `neighbour number' more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we give the current status of developments in this area. Accompanying the paper is the first public release of the NDSPMHD SPH code, a 1, 2 and 3 dimensional code designed as a testbed for SPH/SPMHD algorithms that can be used to test many of the ideas and used to run all of the numerical examples contained in the paper.},

We study the laser-induced melting of a random bed of stainless steel 316 particles on a solid substrate (1000 $\mu$m × 300 $\mu$m × 50 $\mu$m) and its solidification into either a continuous track or a discontinuous track as a result of Plateau-Rayleigh instability. Our approach couples thermal diffusion to hydrodynamics and accounts for temperature dependent material properties and surface tension, as well as the random particle distribution. The simulations give new physical insight that should prove useful for development of continuum models, where the powder is homogenized. We validate our approach against the experiment and find that we match the main laser track characteristics.},

In experimental and numerical studies with viscoelastic fluids in such lid-driven flows, purely-elastic instabilities have been shown to appear even at very low Reynolds numbers. A finite-volume viscoelastic code, using the log-conformation formulation, is used in this work to probe the effect of viscoelasticity on the appearance of such instabilities in two-dimensional lid-driven cavities for a wide range of aspect ratios (0.125≤$\Lambda$=height/length≤4.0), at different Deborah numbers under creeping-flow conditions and to understand the effects of regularization of the lid velocity.

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze explicit exponential Runge-Kutta methods for the time integration of semilinear parabolic problems. The analysis is performed in an abstract Banach space framework of sectorial operators and locally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities. We commence by giving a new and short derivation of the classical (nonstiff) order conditions for exponential Runge-Kutta methods, but the main interest of our paper lies in the stiff case. By expanding the errors of the numerical method in terms of the solution, we derive new order conditions that form the basis of our error bounds for parabolic problems. We show convergence for methods up to order four, and we analyze methods that were recently presented in the literature. These methods have classical order four, but they do not satisfy some of the new conditions. Therefore, an order reduction is expected. We present numerical experiments which show that this order reduction in fact arises in practical examples. Based on our new conditions, we finally construct methods that do not suffer from order reduction. {\textcopyright} 2005 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {We review the topic of entropy stability of discrete schemes, finite-difference and finite-volume schemes, for the approximate solution of nonlinear systems of conservation laws. The question of entropy stability plays an important role in both, the theory and computation of such systems, which is reflected by the extensive literature on this topic. Here we focus on a several key ingredients in the study of entropy stable schemes. Our main theme is the investigation of entropy stability using a comparison principle. Thus for example, the entropy stability of scalar monotone schemes follows from a comparison with constant solutions, and the more general E-schemes are stable by a comparison with Godunov solvers. For system of conservation laws, entropy stability is investigated by comparing the amount of their numerical viscosity with that of certain entropy conservative fluxes. These ingredients are explored in the context of first- and second-order schemes and lend themselves to higher-order methods and multidimensional schemes on unstructured grids.},

This statement then leads to a method of thermodynamic optimization based on entropy production minimization. Exergy destruction (difference between exergy of fuel and exhausts) is also given by entropy production inside the device. Therefore, assessing efficiency of a device by exergy analysis is also based on the Gouy-Stodola theorem. However, assumptions that had led to the Gouy-Stodola theorem are not satisfied in several optimization scenarios, e.g. non-isothermal steady-state fuel cells, where both entropy production minimization and exergy analysis should be used with caution. We demonstrate, using non-equilibrium thermodynamics, a few cases where entropy production minimization and exergy analysis should not be applied.},

abstract = {The sharp-interface resolution of compressible liquid-vapor flows is cumbersome due to the necessary tracking of the interface. The global dynamics are governed by local interface phenomena like surface tension effects as well as mass and energy transfer across the interface. These effects impose subtle jump conditions that have to be resolved locally at the interface. The exact solution of the two-phase Riemann problem is done by a complicated time-consuming iteration process. In addition most of the detailed knowledge of the Riemann pattern is not used in the overall algorithm such that the development of a much simpler approximative Riemann solver is desirable. The concept in this paper is to use an approximate solution of a two-phase Riemann problem at the phase interface. Extending the classical HLL Riemann solver for compressive shock waves, an additional intermediate state is introduced to distinguish between the liquid and vapor phase and to resolve the phase interface accurately. To get a thermodynamically consistent approximation a kinetic model is applied that determines the phase transition rate. The suitability of this approximative Riemann solver is validated by comparing the numerical results to the exact solution in one- and three-dimensional frameworks. The evaporation rates are compared to experiments with rapid evaporation and boiling. The two-phase approximative Riemann solver is then used in a compressible two-phase code with a sharp-interface resolution based on a ghost fluid approximation with data from this novel approximative two-phase Riemann solver. For a shock-droplet interaction this method provides a fast and accurate resolution of phase transfer and surface tension effects at much lower costs than the exact solution.},

abstract = {In the spirit of Prandtl's conjecture of 1926, for turbulence at high Reynolds number we present an analogy with the kinetic theory of gases, with dipoles made of quasi-rigid and 'dressed' vortex tubes as frictionless, incompressible but deformable quasi-particles. Their movements are governed by Helmholtz' elementary vortex rules applied locally. A contact interaction or 'collision' leads either to random scatter of a trajectory or to the formation of two likewise rotating, fundamentally unstable whirls forming a dissipative patch slowly rotating around its center of mass which is almost at rest. This approach predicts von Karman's constant as 1/sqrt(2 pi) = 0.399 and the spatio-temporal dynamics of energy-containing time and length scales controlling turbulent mixing [Baumert 2009]. A link to turbulence spectra was missing so far. In the present paper it is shown that the above image of random vortex-dipole movements is compatible with Kolmogorov's turbulence spectra if dissipative patches, beginning as two likewise rotating eddies, evolve locally into a space-filling bearing in the sense of Herrmann [1990], i.e. into an "Apollonian gear". Its parts and pieces are incompressible and flexibly deformable vortex tubes which are frictionless, excepting the dissipative scale of size zero. For steady and locally homogeneous conditions our approach predicts the dimensionless pre-factor in the 3D Eulerian wavenumber spectrum as [(4 pi){\^{}}2/3]/3 = 1.8, and in the Lagrangian frequency spectrum as 2. Our derivations rest on geometry, methods from many-particle physics, and on elementary conservation laws.},

abstract = {Springer Complexity is a publication program, cutting across all traditional disci-plines of sciences as well as engineering, economics, medicine, psychology and computer sciences, which is aimed at researchers, students and practitioners working in the field of complex systems. Complex Systems are systems that comprise many interacting parts with the ability to generate a new quality of macroscopic collec-tive behavior through self-organization, e.g., the spontaneous formation of temporal, spatial or functional structures. This recognition, that the collective behavior of the whole system cannot be simply inferred from the understanding of the behavior of the individual components, has led to various new concepts and sophisticated tools of complexity. The main concepts and tools – with sometimes overlapping contents and methodologies – are the theories of self-organization, complex systems, syner-getics, dynamical systems, turbulence, catastrophes, instabilities, nonlinearity, sto-chastic processes, chaos, neural networks, cellular automata, adaptive systems, and genetic algorithms. The topics treated within Springer Complexity are as diverse as lasers or fluids in physics, machine cutting phenomena of workpieces or electric circuits with feed-back in engineering, growth of crystals or pattern formation in chemistry, morpho-genesis in biology, brain function in neurology, behavior of stock exchange rates in economics, or the formation of public opinion in sociology. All these seemingly quite different kinds of structure formation have a number of important features and underlying structures in common. These deep structural similarities can be ex-ploited to transfer analytical methods and understanding from one field to another. The Springer Complexity program therefore seeks to foster cross-fertilization be-tween the disciplines and a dialogue between theoreticians and experimentalists for a deeper understanding of the general structure and behavior of complex systems. Future scientific and technological developments in many fields will necessarily de-pend upon coming to grips with complex systems. Such systems are complex in both their composition (typically many different kinds of components interacting with each other and their environments on multiple levels) and in the rich diver-sity of behavior of which they are capable. The Springer Series in Understanding Complex Systems series (UCS) promotes new strategies and paradigms for under-standing and realizing applications of complex systems research in a wide variety of fields and endeavors. UCS is explicitly transdisciplinary. It has three main goals: First, to elaborate the concepts, methods and tools of self-organizing dynamical sys-tems at all levels of description and in all scientific fields, especially newly emerging areas within the Life, Social, Behavioral, Economic, Neuro-and Cognitive Sciences (and derivatives thereof); second, to encourage novel applications of these ideas in various fields of Engineering and Computation such as robotics, nano-technology and informatics; third, to provide a single forum within which commonalities and differences in the workings of complex systems may be discerned, hence leading to deeper insight and understanding. UCS will publish monographs and selected edited contributions from specialized conferences and workshops aimed at communicating new findings to a large multidisciplinary audience.},

abstract = {The use of moment closures for the prediction of continuum and moderately non-equilibrium flows offers modelling and numerical advantages over other methods. The maximum-entropy hierarchy of moment closures holds the promise of robustly hyperbolic stable moment equations, however their are two issues that limit their practical implementation. Firstly, for closures that have a treatment for heat transfer, fluxes cannot be written in closed form and a very expensive iterative procedure is required at every flux evaluation. Secondly, for these same closures, there are physically possible moment states for which the entropy-maximization problem has no solution and the entire framework breaks down. This paper demonstrates that affordable closed-form moment closures that are inspired by the maximum-entropy framework can be proposed. It is known that closing fluxes in the maximum-entropy hierarchy approach a singularity as the region of non-solvability is approached. This paper shows that, far from a disadvantage, this singularity allows for smooth and accurate prediction of shock-wave structure, even for high Mach numbers. The presence of unphysical “sub-shocks” within shock-profile predictions of traditional closures has long been regarded as an unfortunate limitation of the entire moment-closure technique. The realization that smooth shock profiles are, in fact, possible for moment methods with a moderate number of moments greatly increases the method's applicability to high-speed flows. In this paper, a 5-moment system for a simple one-dimensional gas and a 14-moment system for realistic gases are developed and examined. Numerical solution for shock-waves at a variety of incoming flow Mach numbers demonstrate both the robustness and the accuracy of the closures.},

abstract = {When a concentrated mixture of two immiscible fluid is sheared, a rather complex interface is formed due to the coagulation, rupture, and deformation of droplets. The dynamics and rheological properties of such system is discussed. A semiphenomenological kinetic equation is proposed which describes the time evolution of droplet size and orientation, and also the macroscopic stress in a flow field. The rheological properties are shown to be quite unusual: for example, the steady-state viscosity is independent of the shear rate, while the normal stress difference is nonzero and proportional to the magnitude of the shear rate.},

@article{Moller2009,
abstract = {We propose a new view on yield stress materials. Dense suspensions and many other materials have a yield stress-they flow only if a large enough shear stress is exerted on them. There has been an ongoing debate in the literature on whether true yield stress fluids exist, and even whether the concept is useful. This is mainly due to the experimental difficulties in determining the yield stress. We show that most if not all of these difficulties disappear when a clear distinction is made between two types of yield stress fluids: thixotropic and simple ones. For the former, adequate experimental protocols need to be employed that take into account the time evolution of these materials: ageing and shear rejuvenation. This solves the problem of experimental determination of the yield stress. Also, we show that true yield stress materials indeed exist, and in addition, we account for shear banding that is generically observed in yield stress fluids.},

abstract = {A cellular automaton (CA)-finite element (FE) model and a phase field (PF)-FE model were used to simulate equiaxed dendritic growth during the solidification of hexagonal metals. In the CA-FE model, the conservation equations of mass and energy were solved in order to calculate the temperature field, solute concentration, and the dendritic growth morphology CA-FE simulation results showed reasonable agreement with the previously reported experimental data on secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) vs cooling rate. In the PF model, a PF variable was used to distinguish solid and liquid phases similar to the conventional PF models for solidification of pure materials. Another PF variable was considered to determine the evolution of solute concentration. Validation of both models was performed by comparing the simulation results with the analytical model developed by Lipton-Glicksman-Kurz (LGK), showing quantitatively good agreement in the tip growth velocity at a given melt undercooling. Application to magnesium alloy AZ91 (approximated with the binary Mg-8.9 wt{\%} Al) illustrates the difficulty of modeling dendrite growth in hexagonal systems using CA-FE regarding mesh-induced anisotropy and a better performance of PF-FE in modeling multiple arbitrarily-oriented dendrites growth. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Chinese Society for Metals.},

abstract = {We present a numerical method for modelling two-phase flow through porous media directly at the pore scale. The volume of fluid method is used to capture the interface motion. The volume of fluid equation and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are discretised by the finite volume method using a single fluid methodology, with a discontinuity in the phase properties. Capillary forces are calculated using a new semi-sharp formulation and filtered, to allow for simulations at low capillary numbers and avoid non-physical velocities. They are applied into the Navier-Stokes equations using a semi-implicit formulation, which allows larger time steps at low capillary numbers. The numerical method is verified on several test cases, demonstrating its efficiency, stability and accuracy in modelling multiphase flow through porous media with complex interface motion and irregular solid boundaries. We present two-phase flow simulations on simple pore geometries and study the mechanisms controlling two-phase flow at the pore scale. Particularly, we study the effect of geometry and flow rate on trapping and mobilization of the non-wetting-phase. We introduce a new concept to upscale the subpore-scale forces and find the relations between the flow and the pore-scale pressure drops. These information can be used as input to pore-network models. As an example, we applied this concept to predict the threshold capillary number to prevent trapping during imbibition. Furthermore, we present two-phase flow simulations on two micro-CT images of porous me- dia and show the effect of capillary number on the flow pattern, the trapped non-wetting phase saturation and blob sizes. We present a rigorous approach to relate the pore-scale forces con- trolling the flow to the Darcy-scale parameters and use it to obtain relative permeability curves. Overall, this thesis provides a methodology for a detailed pore-scale analysis of multiphase flow, serving as a rigorous foundation for large-scale modelling and prediction.},

What is the potential involved in such optimization? It is often suggested that it is entropy or entropy production. But entropy is a potential arising in thermodynamics of externally unforced macroscopic systems.

abstract = {After a brief introduction on selective laser melting (SLM) and “ex situ” manufacture of metal matrix composites (MMCs), this paper reviews the capacities and benefits of SLM to activate and control various “in situ” reactions during fabrication of 3D parts. It introduces several systems (such as Al/Fe2O3, AlSi10Mg/SiC, Al/ZnO, Ti/C, Ti/SiC, Ti/Si3N4, Ti/Mo2C, Fe/SiC, etc.) used to manufacture Al-based, Ti-based, and steel-based “in situ” MMCs. Then, it illustrates the novel microstructural characteristics of these SLM-made “in situ” MMCs for different cases, as they may appear from nano-particles to nano-whiskers and dendritic reinforcements homogeneously distributed in a metal matrix. It also focuses on SLM associated “in situ” mechanisms, explaining how an “in situ” reaction propagates based on “decomposition, diffusion, and reformation” and how the growth mechanisms turn into different morphologies such as rounded particles, whiskers, or polygonal block shapes. The influence of various SLM parameters (such as energy density, laser power/speed, powder layer thickness, and the size of initial powder particles) and the SLM “in situ” challenges are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

abstract = {In classical hydrodynamics, the mass flux is universally chosen to be the momentum field. In extended hydrodynamics, the mass flux acquires different terms. The extended hydrodynamics introduced and investigated in this paper uses a one-particle distribution function as the extra state variable chosen to characterize the microstructure.We prove that the extended hydrodynamics is fully autonomous in the sense that it is compatible with thermodynamics (i.e., the entropy does not decrease during the time evolution) and with mechanics (i.e., the part of the time evolution that leaves the entropy unchanged is Hamiltonian). Subsequently, we investigate its possible reductions. In some situations the emerging reduced dynamical theory is the classical hydrodynamics that is fully autonomous (i.e., all the structure that makes the extended theory fully autonomous is kept in the reduced theory). In other situations (for example, when the fluids under investigation have large density gradients) the reduced theories are not fully autonomous. In such a case the reduced theories constitute a family of mutually related dynamical theories (each of them involving a different amount of detail) that we consider to be a mathematical formulation of multiscale (or multilevel) hydrodynamics. It is in the reduced theories belonging to the multiscale hydrodynamics where the terms that emerge in the mass flux take the form of self-diffusion.},

abstract = {In this study, the development of surface structure and porosity of Ti-6Al-4V samples fabricated by selective laser melting under different laser scanning speeds and powder layer thicknesses has been studied and correlated with the melt flow behaviour through both experimental and modelling approaches. The as-fabricated samples were investigated using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The interaction between laser beam and powder particles was studied by both high speed imaging observation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. It was found that at a high laser power and a fixed powder layer thickness (20 $\mu$m), the samples contain particularly low porosity when the laser scanning speeds are below 2700 mm/s. Further increase of scanning speed led to increase of porosity but not significantly. The porosity is even more sensitive to powder layer thickness with the use of thick powder layers (above 40 $\mu$m) leading to significant porosity. The increase of porosity with laser scanning speed and powder layer thickness is not inconsistent with the observed increase in surface roughness complicated by increasingly irregular-shaped laser scanned tracks and an increased number of discontinuity and cave-like pores on the top surfaces. The formation of pores and development of rough surfaces were found by both high speed imaging and modelling, to be strongly associated with unstable melt flow and splashing of molten material.},

abstract = {We explore how the rheology of dense granular flows is affected by the presence of sidewalls. The study is based on discrete element method simulations of plane-shear flows between two rough walls, prescribing both the normal stress and the shear rate. Results confirm previous observations for different systems: large layers near the walls develop where the local viscosity is not constant, but decreases when approaching the walls. The size of these layers can reach several dozen grain diameters, and is found to increase when the flow decelerates, as a power law of the inertial number. Two non-local models are found to adequately explain such features, namely the kinetic elasto-plastic fluidity (KEP) model and the eddy viscosity model (EV). The analysis of the internal kinematics further shows that the vorticity and its associated length scale may be a key component of these non-local behaviours.},

For the neutral state in a magnetic field, small fluctuations include Alfven waves, magnetosonic waves, and the dissipative modes. For the state with a non-zero dynamical charge density in a magnetic field, plasma oscillations gap out all propagating modes, except for Alfven-like waves with a quadratic dispersion relation.

It is conjectured that certain a priori criteria ensure that the numerical method does not produce spurious solutions as the relaxation time vanishes. One criterion is that the limits of vanishing relaxation time and vanishing viscosity commute for the viscous regularization of the hyperbolic system. A second criterion is that a certain "subcharacteristic" condition be satisfied by the hyperbolic system. This conjecture is supported with analytical and numerical results for a specific example, the solution of generalized Riemann problems of a model system of equations with a fractional step scheme in which Godunov's method is coupled with the backward Euler method. Similar ideas are applied to the numerical solution of stiff detonation problems. Key},

@article{Barker2015,
abstract = {In light of the successes of the Navier–Stokes equations in the study of fluid flows, similar continuum treatment of granular materials is a long-standing ambition. This is due to their wide-ranging applications in the pharmaceutical and engineering industries as well as to geophysical phenomena such as avalanches and landslides. Historically this has been attempted through modification of the dissipation terms in the momentum balance equations, effectively introducing pressure and strain-rate dependence into the viscosity. Originally, a popular model for this granular viscosity, the Coulomb rheology, proposed rate-independent plastic behaviour scaled by a constant friction coefficient {\$}{\{}\backslashit\backslashmu{\}}{\$} . Unfortunately, the resultant equations are always ill-posed. Mathematically ill-posed problems suffer from unbounded growth of short-wavelength perturbations, which necessarily leads to grid-dependent numerical results that do not converge as the spatial resolution is enhanced. This is unrealistic as all physical systems are subject to noise and do not blow up catastrophically. It is therefore vital to seek well-posed equations to make realistic predictions. The recent {\$}{\{}\backslashit\backslashmu{\}}(I){\$} -rheology is a major step forward, which allows granular flows in chutes and shear cells to be predicted. This is achieved by introducing a dependence on the non-dimensional inertial number {\$}I{\$} in the friction coefficient {\$}{\{}\backslashit\backslashmu{\}}{\$} . In this paper it is shown that the {\$}{\{}\backslashit\backslashmu{\}}(I){\$} -rheology is well-posed for intermediate values of {\$}I{\$} , but that it is ill-posed for both high and low inertial numbers. This result is not obvious from casual inspection of the equations, and suggests that additional physics, such as enduring force chains and binary collisions, becomes important in these limits. The theoretical results are validated numerically using two implicit schemes for non-Newtonian flows. In particular, it is shown explicitly that at a given resolution a standard numerical scheme used to compute steady-uniform Bagnold flow is stable in the well-posed region of parameter space, but is unstable to small perturbations, which grow exponentially quickly, in the ill-posed domain.},

abstract = {The metric-affine gauge theory of gravity encompasses a space-time with the following geometrical fields: coframe ??, metric g, and an independent linear connection ???. Within this geometrical framework, all four-forms B = dC are constructed which qualify as boundary terms for a gauge Lagrangian, that is, they are GL(4,R)-scalars as well as exact forms derived from Chern-Simons type three-forms C. The result of our search is summarized in Eq. (4.20). The translational piece dCTT is new. The boundary terms effectively serve as Lagrangians for the Bianchi identities of nonmetricity, torsion, and curvature. In the canonical formalism, the normal parts of the Chern-Simons three-forms represent generating functions that are capable of generating new Ashtekar type variables. Eventually, the Bach-Lanczos identity is generalized to the metric-affine space-time. ? 1991 American Institute of Physics.},

The microscopic nature of the heat that becomes important, in particular in nanoscale systems, is characterized by a vector field related to the heat flux on the Cattaneo level and by the phonon distribution function on the Peierls level. All dynamical theories discussed in the paper are fully nonlinear and all are proven to be compatible among themselves, with equilibrium thermodynamics, and with mechanics. An investigation of the first two compatibilities gives rise to potentials having the physical interpretation of nonequilibrium entropies. The compatibility with mechanics is manifested by the Hamiltonian structure of the time-reversible part of the time evolution.},

abstract = {High-dimensional PDEs have been a longstanding computational challenge. We propose to solve high-dimensional PDEs by approximating the solution with a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the differential operator, initial condition, and boundary conditions. Our algorithm is meshfree, which is key since meshes become infeasible in higher dimensions. Instead of forming a mesh, the neural network is trained on batches of randomly sampled time and space points. The algorithm is tested on a class of high-dimensional free boundary PDEs, which we are able to accurately solve in up to {\$}200{\$} dimensions. The algorithm is also tested on a high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE and Burgers' equation. The deep learning algorithm approximates the general solution to the Burgers' equation for a continuum of different boundary conditions and physical conditions (which can be viewed as a high-dimensional space). We call the algorithm a "Deep Galerkin Method (DGM)" since it is similar in spirit to Galerkin methods, with the solution approximated by a neural network instead of a linear combination of basis functions. In addition, we prove a theorem regarding the approximation power of neural networks for a class of quasilinear parabolic PDEs.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}As microelectronic devices are important in many applications, their heat management needs to be improved, in order to prolong their lifetime, and to reduce the risk of damage. In nanomaterials, heat transport shows different behaviors than what can be observed at macroscopic sizes. Studying heat transport through nanofilms is a necessary tool for nanodevice thermal management. This work proposes a thermodynamic model incorporating both ballistic, introduced by non-local effects, and diffusive phonon transport. Extended thermodynamics principles are used in order to develop a constitutive equation for the ballistic behavior of heat conduction at small-length scales. Being an irreversible process, the present two-temperature model contains a one-way transition of ballistic to diffusive phonons as time proceeds. The model is compared to the classical Fourier and Cattaneo laws. These laws were not able to present the non-locality that our model shows, which is present in cases when the length scale of the material is of the same order of magnitude or smaller than the phonon mean free path, i.e., when the Knudsen number K n ≤ O ( 1 ) . Moreover, for small K n numbers, our model predicted behaviors close to that of the classical laws, with a weak temperature jump at both sides of the nanofilm. However, as K n increases, the behavior changes completely, the ballistic component becomes more important, and the temperature jump at both sides of the nanofilms becomes more pronounced. For comparison, a model using Fourier's and Cattaneo's laws with an effective thermal conductivity has shown, with reasonable qualitative comparison for small Knudsen numbers and large times.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {A sharp interface method (SIM) for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has been developed to simulate two-phase flows with clear interfaces. The level set function is introduced to capture the interface implicitly. The interface velocity is used to evolve the level set function. The smoothness of the level set function helps to improve the accuracy of the interface curvature. Material discontinuity across the interface is dealt with by the ghost fluid method. The interface states are calculated by applying the jump conditions and are extended to the corresponding ghost fluid particles. The ghost fluid method helps to get smooth and stable calculation near the interface. The performance of the developed method is validated by benchmark tests. The developed SIM for SPH can be applied to simulate low speed two-phase flows of high density ratios with clear interface accurately and stably.},

@article{Oono1998,
abstract = {The present paper reports our attempt to search for a new universal framework in nonequilibrium physics. We propose a thermodynamic formalism that is expected to apply to a large class of nonequilibrium steady states including a heat conducting fluid, a sheared fluid, and an electrically conducting fluid. We call our theory steady state thermodynamics (SST) after Oono and Paniconi's original proposal. The construction of SST is based on a careful examination of how the basic notions in thermodynamics should be modified in nonequilibrium steady states. We define all thermodynamic quantities through operational procedures which can be (in principle) realized experimentally. Based on SST thus constructed, we make some nontrivial predictions, including an extension of Einstein's formula on density fluctuation, an extension of the minimum work principle, the existence of a new osmotic pressure of a purely nonequilibrium origin, and a shift of coexistence temperature. All these predictions may be checked experimentally to test SST for its quantitative validity.},

Such behavior is particularly interesting in a scenario where the environmental work sources are relatively difficult to access, so that only the proper orchestration of many distinct catalytic actors can power the dissipative flux required to maintain a stable, far-from-equilibrium steady state. In this article, we study the dynamics of an in silico chemical network with random connectivity in an environment that makes strong thermodynamic forcing available only to rare combinations of chemical concentrations. We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing.},

We propose a generalization of the setting of the moment-closure problem from relative entropy to $\phi$-divergences and a corresponding closure procedure based on minimization of $\phi$-divergences. The proposed description encapsulates as special cases Grad's classical closure based on expansion in Hermite polynomials and Levermore's entropy-based closure. We establish that the generalization to divergence-based closures enables the construction of extended thermodynamic theories that avoid essential limitations of the standard moment-closure formulations such as inadmissibility of the approximate phase-space distribution, potential loss of hyperbolicity and singularity of flux functions at local equilibrium. The divergence-based closure leads to a hierarchy of tractable symmetric hyperbolic systems that retain the fundamental structural properties of the Boltzmann equation.},

The focus of the paper is ductile fracture, although the underlying model is applicable to a broad range of materials and could be adapted to other problems. An Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) numerical scheme is proposed that includes methods for modelling material imperfections and the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of arbitrary macro-scale crack networks. Furthermore, a method is proposed for identifying fragments on an AMR hierarchy in order to compute fragment statistics. The method is demonstrated through the simulation of high-strain rate fragmentation of metal rings. The predicted fragment characteristics are shown to be in good agreement with experimental data.},

@article{Hutter2018,
abstract = {The smaller the scales on which complex fluids are studied, the more fluctuations become relevant, e.g. in microrheology and nanofluidics. In this paper, a general approach is presented for including fluctuations in conformation-tensor based models for viscoelasticity, in accordance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. It is advocated to do this not for the conformation tensor itself, but rather for its so-called contravariant decomposition, in order to circumvent two major numerical complications. These are potential violation of the positive semi-definiteness of the conformation tensor, and numerical instabilities that occur even in the absence of fluctuations. Using the general procedure, fluctuating versions are derived for the upper-convected Maxwell model, the FENE-P model, and the Giesekus model. Finally, it is shown that the fluctuating viscoelasticity proposed here naturally reduces to the fluctuating Newtonian fluid dynamics of Landau and Lifshitz [L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 6 of Course of Theoretical Physics, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1959], in the limit of vanishingly small relaxation time.},

abstract = {Continuous models of material degradation may cease to produced meaningful results in the presence of high strain gradients. These gradients may occur for instance in the propagation of waves with high wave numbers and at stress concentrators. Adding nonlocal or gradient terms to the constitutive modelling may enhance the ability of the models to describe such situations. The effect of adding nonlocal or gradient terms and the relation between these enhancements are examined in a continuum damage setting. A nonlocal damage model and two different gradient damage models are considered. In one of the gradient models higher order deformation gradients enter the equilibrium equations explicity, while in the other model the gradient influence follows in a more implicit way from an additional partial differential equation. The latter, implicit gradient formulation can be rewritten in the integral format of the nonlocal model and can therefore be regarded as truly nonlocal. This is not true for the explicit formulation, in which the nonlocality is limited to an infinitesimal volume. This fundamental difference between the formulations results in quite different behaviour in wave propagation, localisation and at crack tips. This is shown for the propagation of waves in the models, their localisation properties and the behaviour at a crack tip. The responses of the nonlocal model and the implicit gradient model agree remarkably well in these situations, while the explicit gradient formulation shows an entirely different and sometimes nonphysical response. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is shown that the results given in {\S} 75 of the book Electrodynamics of Continuous Media by L D Landau and E M Lifshitz (Moscow: Nauka, 1982, in Russian) and in {\S} 105 of the book Fundamentals of the Theory of Electricity by I E Tamm (Moscow: Nauka, 1989, in Russian) unambiguously follow only from the Maxwell equations of macroscopic electrodynamics, the corresponding constitutive equations, and the equations of motion of a substance (the hydrodynamic equations). These results are as follows: (1) the force acting on a unit volume of a motionless substance is given by the sum of the Helmholtz force and the Abraham force; (2) the momentum density of an electromagnetic field is the Umov–Poynting vector divided by c 2 , and (3) the stress tensor related to the field coincides in its form with the sum of the stress tensor of the electrostatic field and the stress tensor of the magnetostatic field. Thus, it is proved that the symmetric form of the Abraham tensor stands for the energy–momentum tensor of an electromagnetic field in a motionless medium.},

The six first class constraints corresponding to the local Lorentz transformation in Teleparallel gravity become second class constraints in {\$}f(T){\$} gravity, which leads to the appearance of three extra degrees of freedom and the violation of the local Lorentz invariance in {\$}f(T){\$} gravity. In general, there are {\$}D-1{\$} extra degrees of freedom for {\$}f(T){\$} gravity in {\$}D{\$} dimensions, and this implies that the extra degrees of freedom correspond to one massive vector field or one massless vector field with one scalar field.},

@article{Barkley2015,
abstract = {Over a century of research into the origin of turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows has resulted in a puzzling picture in which turbulence appears in a variety of different states competing with laminar background flow. At moderate flow speeds, turbulence is confined to localized patches; it is only at higher speeds that the entire flow becomes turbulent. The origin of the different states encountered during this transition, the front dynamics of the turbulent regions and the transformation to full turbulence have yet to be explained. By combining experiments, theory and computer simulations, here we uncover a bifurcation scenario that explains the transformation to fully turbulent pipe flow and describe the front dynamics of the different states encountered in the process. Key to resolving this problem is the interpretation of the flow as a bistable system with nonlinear propagation (advection) of turbulent fronts. These findings bridge the gap between our understanding of the onset of turbulence and fully turbulent flows.},

Sci. 2003, 59, 3713) is based on a simple device, where an additional ejector pin is pushed on the injection molded part at different times during the solidification phase. The 'indentation depth profile', i.e., residual deformation as a function of time, was obtained and allowed to determine the evolution of the solidification front in the mold as a function of the cooling time. The present work shows the reliability and the powerfulness of the aforementioned method for a large variety of different semicrystalline polymers (PET, PBT, polyamide-6 PA6, isotactic poly(propylene) iPP) characterized also by different molecular weight and/or nucleating agents. The results show that the indentation test may be considered as a 'predictive' tool to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the solidification process of different polymers and polymer grades during injection molding. {\textcopyright} 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

The action is manifestly Lorentz invariant when besides the tetrad one allows for flat but nontrivial spin connection. We derive the field equations and demonstrate how the antisymmetric part of the tetrad equations is automatically satisfied when the spin connection equation holds. The spin connection equation is a vital part of the covariant formulation, since it determines the spin connection compatible with a given tetrad. We discuss how the spin connection equation can be solved in general, and provide the cosmological and spherically symmetric examples. Finally we generalize the theory to an arbitrary number of scalar fields.},

As an illustration we consider here the case of a rigid heat conductor subject to heating. The expression of the entropy flux is determined by the expressions of the evolution equations of the basic variables. It is shown that the coefficient relating entropy and heat fluxes differs far from equilibrium from the inverse of the non-equilibrium temperature $\theta$. The particular case in which these two quantities are identical is examined in detail. A simple but intuitive physical illustration of the results is proposed. A comparison with information theory is also made: it is shown that agreement with Boltzmann's distribution function requires the introduction of non-local terms. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Pimenta2017,
abstract = {In this work, we modify the viscoelastic solver available in the OpenFOAM{\textregistered} toolbox (Favero et al., 2010), in order to improve its stability for differential-type constitutive equations. The Oldroyd-B constitutive equation is solved using the log-conformation approach and the high-resolution schemes used to discretize the convective terms are handled with a component-wise and deferred correction approach. The pressure-velocity coupling is ensured using the SIMPLEC algorithm, and a new stress-velocity coupling term is also introduced. We demonstrate that the new solver is second-order accurate, both in space and time, by assessing the performance in problems with known analytical solution and using Richardson's extrapolation. The solver is further tested on the 4:1 planar contraction benchmark problem using an Oldroyd-B fluid ($\beta$ = 1/9) at low Reynolds number flow conditions (Re= 0.01), considering a wide range of Deborah numbers, 0 ≤De≤ 12. A good agreement with reference works is observed at low De, as well as with an in-house viscoelastic flow solver. At higher De, the vortex dynamics is essentially controlled by the singularity region in the re-entrant corner of the contraction, revealing a significant dependence of the numerical results on the mesh resolution. The corner vortex dynamics is also analyzed, from the flow startup at several De, providing new accurate data on the transient behavior of this problem. In summary, this work provides a robust open-source solver for viscoelastic flows, as well as new data on an old problem, which has still open questions and challenges.},

abstract = {In Einstein's gravitational theory, the spacetime is Riemannian, that is, it has vanishing torsion and vanishing nonmetricity (covariant derivative of the metric). In the gauging of the general affine group A(4, R) and of its subgroup GL(4, R) in four dimensions, energy-momentum and hypermomentum currents of matter are canonically coupled to the coframe and to the connection of a metric-affine spacetime with nonvanishing torsion and nonmetricity, respectively. Fermionic matter can be described in this framework by half-integer representations of the SL(4, R) covering subgroup. We set up a (first-order) Lagrangian formalism and build up the corresponding Noether machinery. For an arbitrary gauge Lagrangian, the three gauge field equations come out in a suggestive Yang-Mills like form. The conservation-type differential identities for energy-momentum and hypermomentum and the corresponding complexes and superpotentials are derived. Limiting cases such as the Einstein-Cartan theory are discussed. In particular we show, how the A(4, R) may "break down" to the Poincar?? (inhomogeneous Lorentz) group. In this context, we present explicit models for a symmetry breakdown in the cases of the Weyl (or homothetic) group, the SL(4, R), or the GL(4, R). ?? 1995.},

In spite of this equivalence, it provides a whole new insight into gravitation. It breaks several paradigms related to the geometric approach of general relativity, and introduces new concepts in the description of the gravitational interaction. The purpose of this chapter is to explore some of these concepts, as well as discuss possible consequences for gravitation, mainly those that could be relevant for the quantization of the gravitational field.},

abstract = {A new closure for Grad's 13 moment equations is presented that adds terms of Super-Burnett order to the balances of pressure deviator and heat flux vector. The additional terms are derived from equations for higher moments by means of the distribution function for 13 moments. The resulting system of equations contains the Burnett and Super-Burnett equations when expanded in a series in the Knudsen number. However, other than the Burnett and Super-Burnett equations, the new set of equations is linearly stable for all wavelengths and frequencies. Dispersion relation and damping for the new equations agree better with experimental data than those for the Navier–Stokes–Fourier equations, or the original 13 moments system. The new equations also allow the description of Knudsen boundary layers.},

abstract = {We explore measures to increase the accuracy of SPH methods with respect to commonly used standard techniques. Our main focus here is special-relativistic SPH, but all measures can straight forwardly be applied in the Newtonian case as well. The first improvement concerns the calculation of gradients. Here a scheme that requires the (analytical) inversion of a small matrix is explored. For regular particle distributions this scheme yields gradient estimates that are many orders of magnitude more accurate than the standard SPH gradient. We apply such gradients in fully conservative special-relativistic SPH formulations and find in a large number of benchmark tests that they substantially increase SPH's accuracy. As a second measure, we explore a large number of kernel functions. The most commonly used cubic spline SPH kernel performs rather poorly, the best overall results are obtained for a high-order Wendland kernel which allows for only very little sub-resolution particle motion (noise) and enforces a very regular particle distribution. As a third improvement, we generalize a recently suggested SPH volume element to the special-relativistic case and find, as intended, that they remove surface tension effects and enhance the treatment of fluid instabilities. Fourth, we design new ways to steer dissipation with accurate triggers on both shocks and velocity noise. All tests, Newtonian and special-relativistic, are performed with a new SPH code, called SPHINCS{\_}SR. The new SPH formulation that includes all these improvements yields excellent results even in cases where standard techniques (high, constant dissipation; standard volume element; kernel gradients and the cubic spline kernel) completely fail (e.g. Gresho-Chan vortex or weakly triggered instabilities).},

abstract = {We develop a new family of well-balanced path-conservative quadrature-free one-step ADER finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes on unstructured meshes for the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations with non-conservative products and stiff source terms. The fully discrete formulation is derived using the recently developed framework of explicit one-step PNPM schemes of arbitrary high order of accuracy in space and time for conservative hyperbolic systems [Dumbser M, Balsara D, Toro EF, Munz CD. A unified framework for the construction of one-step finite-volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes. J Comput Phys 2008;227:8209–53]. The two key ingredients of our high order approach are: first, the high order accurate PNPM reconstruction operator on unstructured meshes, using the WENO strategy presented in [Dumbser M, K{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}ser M, Titarev VA Toro EF. Quadrature-free non-oscillatory finite volume schemes on unstructured meshes for nonlinear hyperbolic systems. J Comput Phys 2007;226:204–43] to ensure monotonicity at discontinuities, and second, a local space–time Galerkin scheme to predict the evolution of the reconstructed polynomial data inside each element during one time step to obtain a high order accurate one-step time discretization. This approach is also able to deal with stiff source terms as shown in [Dumbser M, Enaux C, Toro EF. Finite volume schemes of very high order of accuracy for stiff hyperbolic balance laws. J Comput Phys 2008;227:3971–4001]. These two key ingredients are combined with the recently developed path-conservative methods of Par{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}s [Par{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}s C. Numerical methods for nonconservative hyperbolic systems: a theoretical framework. SIAM J Numer Anal 2006;44:300–21] and Castro et al. [Castro MJ, Gallardo JM, Par{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}s C.

abstract = {In the general setting of the problem, the explicit compact formulae are derived for the ponderomotive forces in the macroscopic electrodynamics of moving media in the Minkowski and Abraham approaches. Taking account of the Minkowski constitutive relations and making use of a special representation for the Abraham energymomentum tensor enable one to obtain a compact expression for the Abraham force in the case of arbitrary dependence of the medium velocity on spatial coordinates and the time and for nonstationary external electromagnetic field. We term the difference between the ponderomotive forces in the Abraham and Minkowski approaches as the Abraham force not only under consideration of media at rest but also in the case of moving media. The Lorentz force is found which is exerted by external electromagnetic field on the conduction current in a medium, the covariant Ohm law, and the constitutive Minkowski relations being taken into account. The physical argumentation is traced for the definition of the 4-vector of the ponderomotive force as the 4-divergence of the energy-momentum tensor of electromagnetic field in a medium.},

abstract = {We study the mechanical response under time-dependent sources of a simple class of holographic models that exhibit viscoelastic features. The ratio of viscosity over elastic modulus defines an intrinsic relaxation time scale -- the so-called Maxwell relaxation time {\$}\backslashtau{\_}M{\$} -- that should determine the relaxation time. We compute explicitly the actual relaxation time and find that it is not really set by the Maxwell time but rather by the least damped quasi-normal mode. At high temperatures {\$}\backslashtau{\_}M{\$} over-estimates the actual relaxation time, although not by much and moreover it still captures reasonably well the temperature behaviour. At sufficiently low temperature the situation is reversed: {\$}\backslashtau{\_}M{\$} underestimates the actual relaxation time, in some cases quite drastically. Moreover, when {\$}\backslashtau{\_}M{\$} under-estimates the real-time response exhibits an over-shoot phenomenon before relaxation. We comment on the {\$}T=0{\$} limit, where the relaxation is power-law because our models exhibit criticality.},

This type of theories is fully described in terms of evolution variables whose dynamics is governed by total divergence-type conservation laws. Specifically, we give a characterization of the whole family of conformal fluids in terms of a single master scalar function defined up to second order corrections in dissipative effects, which we explicitly find in general form. This allows us to identify the equilibrium states of the theory, as well as to derive constitutive relations and a Fourier-like law for the corresponding first-order theory heat flux. Finally, we show that among this class of theories-- and near equilibrium configurations-- there exist symmetric hyperbolic ones, implying that for them one can define well posed initial value problems.},

abstract = {We consider a resistive multi-fluid framework from the 3+1 space-time foliation point-of-view, paying particular attention to issues relating to the use of multi-parameter equations of state and the associated inversion from evolved to primitive variables. We highlight relevant numerical issues that arise for general systems with relative flows. As an application of the new formulation, we consider a three-component system relevant for hot neutron stars. In this case we let the baryons (neutrons and protons) move together, but allow heat and electrons to exhibit relative flow. This reduces the problem to three momentum equations; overall energy-momentum conservation, a generalised Ohm's law and a heat equation. Our results provide a hierarchy of increasingly complex models and prepare the ground for new state-of-the-art simulations of relevant scenarios in relativistic astrophysics.},

abstract = {UDC 662.215.25 + 621.791 1. To explain the effect of an increase in the destructive action of high-explosive charges which have cavities with metal conical jackets [1, 2], a hydrodynamic cumulation theory [3, 4], based on representing the metal by a cumulative shell in the form of an ideal incompressible fluid, was created. By using the known solution of the classical hydrodynamics problem about the collision of plane jets, the authors of the theory predicted the formation of a high-velocity metal jet which would appear upon coIlapse of the cumu-lative sheI1. The interaetion of this jet with an obstacle, which is an inverse collapse process, governs the penetration capability of cumulative charges. The high-velocity jet parameters [4] Uj = D sin (;='-{\~{}})sm :, [t : COSs, , {\~{}} 7 Y + tg L{\~{}}] ' (1) mj --m(l --cos 10 2 ' (2) were determined by computations, where Uj is the jet velocity, D is the velocity of high-explosive detona-tion, 2a is the initial angle at the cavity vertex, 2y is the angle between the moving walls of the shell (the collision angle), m is the mass per unit length of the collapsing part of the shell, and m i is the mass per unit length of the jet. In deriving (1), (2) it was assumed that the detonation wave moves along the bisectrix of the collision angle, and if it drops normally to the shell surface, the expression for the jet velocity (1) will simplify [3],},

The objectives of the present study were 1) to assess the emotional response to new products (fruit and vegetable smoothies in a drink pouch) in two different scenarios: looking at the smoothie pouch, or tasting the smoothie with the smoothie pouch alongside; 2) to compare the information obtained when the participants use photographs or use words to express emotions. In the Pack-alone scenario, similar emotional spaces and sample configurations were obtained with both images and words. In the Pack-and-tasting scenario, the richness of the emotional response increased when using images. In both scenarios, the participants used a greater number of negative emotions when these were presented as images rather than as words. This could be considered an advantage, as it enables some negative emotional loads to be portrayed. The present results also demonstrate that evaluating the emotional response allows effective discrimination between samples with similar overall liking scores.},

@article{Krylov2012,
abstract = {During the last decade, new interesting physical objects have been invented and investigated - 'acoustic black holes', whereby it is possible to achieve almost 100{\%} absorption of the incident wave energy. The main principle of the 'acoustic black hole effect' is based on a gradual power-law-type decrease in velocity of the incident wave with propagation distance, linear or faster, to almost zero, which should be accompanied by efficient energy absorption in the area of low velocity via inserted highly absorbing materials. So far, this effect has been investigated mainly for flexural waves in thin plates for which the required gradual reduction in wave velocity with distance can be easily achieved by changing the plate local thickness according to a power law, with the power-law exponent being equal or larger than two. The present paper provides a brief review of the theory of acoustic black holes, including their comparison with 'optic black holes' invented about three years ago. It is shown in particular that optic black holes are based on the same principle that governs the behaviour of acoustic black holes. Review is also given of the recent, mainly experimental, work carried out at Loughborough University on damping structural vibrations based on the acoustic black hole effect. This is followed by the discussion on potential applications of the acoustic black hole effect for sound absorption in air.},

abstract = {Our main objective is to describe non-Fickean thermodiffusion in binary fluids within the framework of three recent theories of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, namely Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics (EIT), GENERIC (General Equation for the Non-Equilibrium Reversible Irreversible Coupling) and Thermodynamics with Internal Variables (IVT). In the first part presented in this paper, we develop the EIT description. For pedagogical reasons, we start from the simplest situation to end with the most intricate one. Therefore, we first examine the simple problem of mass diffusion at uniform temperature. Then we study heat transport in a one-component fluid before considering the more complex coupled heat and mass transfer. In Part II developed in the accompanying paper, we follow the same hierarchy of situations from the point of view of GENERIC. Finally, in Part III, we present the point of view of the thermodynamic theory of internal variables. Similarities and differences between EIT, GENERIC and IVT are stressed. In the present work, we have taken advantage of the problem of heat conduction to revisit the notion of caloric.},

This training and knowledge here is used to the benefit of the readers as an overview of this scene with the aim to delineate further avenues of development within the framework of the trilateral seminar held in Wittenberg (2010). Starting essentially with Pierre Duhem and the Cosserat brothers, this specialized, albeit vast, field of continuum mechanics has developed by successive abandonments of the working hypotheses at the basis of standard continuum mechanics, that mechanics masterly devised by Euler and Cauchy and some of their successors in the 19th century (Piola, Kirchhoff, etc.). In the present survey we briefly analyze successive steps such as the introduction of nonsymmetric stresses, couple stresses, internal degrees of freedom and microstructure, the introduction of strain gradient theories, and material inhomogeneities with a length scale, nonlocality of the weak and strong types, the loss of Euclidean geometry to describe the material manifold, and finally the loss of classical differentiability of basic operations as can occur in a deformable fractal material object. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

It is a rapidly evolving technology with certain advantages and with unique challenges that include low imaging quality and high variability. From the perspective of image analysis, it is essential to develop advanced automatic US image analysis methods to assist in US diagnosis and/or to make such assessment more objective and accurate. Deep learning has recently emerged as the leading machine learning tool in various research fields, and especially in general imaging analysis and computer vision. Deep learning also shows huge potential for various automatic US image analysis tasks. This review first briefly introduces several popular deep learning architectures, and then summarizes and thoroughly discusses their applications in various specific tasks in US image analysis, such as classification, detection, and segmentation. Finally, the open challenges and potential trends of the future application of deep learning in medical US image analysis are discussed.},

@article{Kamrin2017a,
abstract = {Granular materials have a strange propensity to behave as either a complex media or a simple media depending on the precise question being asked. This review paper offers a summary of granular flow rheologies for well-developed or steady-state motion, and seeks to explain this dichotomy through the vast range of complexity intrinsic to these models. A key observation is that to achieve accuracy in predicting flow fields in general geometries, one requires a model that accounts for a number of subtleties, most notably a nonlocal effect to account for cooperativity in the flow as induced by the finite size of grains. On the other hand, forces and tractions that develop on macro-scale, submerged boundaries appear to be minimally affected by grain size and, barring very rapid motions, are well represented by simple rate-independent frictional plasticity models. A major simplification observed in experiments of granular intrusion, which we refer to as the 'resistive force hypothesis' of granular Resistive Force Theory, can be shown to arise directly from rate-independent plasticity. Because such plasticity models have so few parameters, and the major rheological parameter is a dimensionless internal friction coefficient, some of these simplifications can be seen as consequences of scaling.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new sliding mesh technique for the computation of unsteady viscous flows in the presence of rotating bodies. The compressible Euler and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a higher-order ({\textgreater}2) finite volume method on unstructured grids. A sliding mesh approach is employed at the interface between computational grids in relative motion. In order to prevent loss of accuracy, two distinct families of higher-order sliding mesh interfaces are developed. These approaches fit naturally in a high-order finite volume framework. To this end, Moving Least Squares (MLS) approximants are used for the transmission of the information from one grid to another. A particular attention is paid for the study of the accuracy and conservation properties of the numerical scheme for static and rotating grids. The capabilities of the present solver to compute complex unsteady vortical flow motions created by rotating geometries are illustrated on a cross-flow configuration.},

abstract = {In laser assisted additive manufacturing (AM) an accurate estimation of residual stresses and distortion is necessary to achieve dimensional accuracy and prevent premature fatigue failure, delamination and buckling of components. Since many process variables affect AM, experimental measurements of residual stresses and distortion are time consuming and expensive. Numerical thermo-mechanical models can be used for their estimation, but the quality of calculations depends critically on the accurate transient temperature field which affects both the residual stresses and distortion. In this study, a well-tested, three-dimensional, transient heat transfer and fluid flow model is used to accurately calculate transient temperature field for the residual stress and distortion modeling. The calculated residual stress distributions are compared with independent experimental results. It is shown that the residual stresses can be significantly minimized by reducing the layer thickness during AM. Inconel 718 components are found to be more susceptible to delamination than Ti-6Al-4V parts because they encounter higher residual stresses compared to their yield strength.},

While currently used primarily to manufacture prototypes and mockups, a number of promising applications exist in the production of replacement parts, dental crowns, and artificial limbs, as well as in bridge manufacturing. 3-D printing has been compared to such disruptive technologies as digital books and music downloads that enable consumers to order their selections online, allow firms to profitably serve small market segments, and enable companies to operate with little or no unsold finished goods inventory.

abstract = {In this paper we propose a new high order accurate centered path-conservative method on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes for the solution of multi-dimensional non-conservative hyperbolic systems, as they typically arise in the context of compressible multi-phase flows. Our path-conservative centered scheme is an extension of the centered method recently proposed in [40] for conservation laws, to which it reduces if the system matrix is the Jacobian of a flux function. The main advantage in the proposed centered approach compared to upwind methods is that no information about the eigenstructure of the system or Roe averages are needed. The final fully discrete high order accurate formulation in space and time is obtained using the general framework of P N P M schemes proposed in [16], which unifies in one single general family of schemes classical finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin methods. These P N P M methods can also be called reconstructed discontinuous Galerkin schemes, due to the use of the P N P M least-squares reconstruction operator. We show applications of our high order accurate unstructured centered method to the two- and three-dimensional Baer–Nunziato equations of compressible multiphase flows as introduced in [4]. },

abstract = {In this paper, we substantiate the claim implicitly made in previous works that the relaxed micromorphic model is the only linear, isotropic, reversibly elastic, nonlocal generalized continuum model able to describe complete band-gaps on a phenomenological level. To this end, we recapitulate the response of the standard Mindlin–Eringen micromorphic model with the full micro-distortion gradient ∇P, the relaxed micromorphic model depending only on the Curl P of the micro-distortion P, and a variant of the standard micromorphic model, in which the curvature depends only on the divergence Div P of the micro distortion. The Div-model has size-effects, but the dispersion analysis for plane waves shows the incapability of that model to even produce a partial band gap. Combining the curvature to depend quadratically on Div P and Curl P shows that such a model is similar to the standard Mindlin–Eringen model, which can eventually show only a partial band gap.},

@article{Saurel2014,
abstract = {A flow model is built to capture evaporating interfaces separating liquid and vapour. Surface tension, heat conduction, Gibbs free energy relaxation and compressibility effects are considered. The corresponding flow model is hyperbolic, conservative and in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics. Phase transition is considered through Gibbs energy relaxation, in the same mind as in Saurel et al. (2008). Surface tension effects are modelled following the lines of Brackbill et al. (1992). There is thus no need to resolve the interface structure as jump conditions are inherent features of the model formulation. With the present approach, the same set of partial differential equations is solved everywhere, in pure fluids as well as in the captured diffuse interface. There is thus a unique hyperbolic flow solver that handles flow dynamics, interface motion and eventually acoustic wave dynamics. To make distinction between “pure” fluids and liquid–vapour mixture treatment, different sets of algebraic equations are considered in the relaxation solver. To guarantee accurate computation of the liquid and gas dynamics the preconditioned implicit scheme of LeMartelot et al. (2013) is adapted to the present boiling flow model. The model and method are validated against a one-dimensional test problem having exact solution. Multidimensional computations are then shown to illustrate method capabilities.},

abstract = {This paper presents entropy symmetrization and high-order accurate entropy stable schemes for the relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) equations. It is shown that the conservative RMHD equations are not symmetrizable and do not possess an entropy pair. To address this issue, a symmetrizable RMHD system, which admits a convex entropy pair, is proposed by adding a source term into the equations. Arbitrarily high-order accurate entropy stable finite difference schemes are then developed on Cartesian meshes based on the symmetrizable RMHD system. The crucial ingredients of these schemes include (i) affordable explicit entropy conservative fluxes which are technically derived through carefully selected parameter variables, (ii) a special high-order discretization of the source term in the symmetrizable RMHD system, and (iii) suitable high-order dissipative operators based on essentially non-oscillatory reconstruction to ensure the entropy stability. Several benchmark numerical tests demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed entropy stable schemes of the symmetrizable RMHD equations.},

@article{Fu2012,
abstract = {Quantifying large deformation in granular assemblies using concepts originating from continuum mechanics is a challenging task because of (1) the discontinuous nature of granular displacement, which does not allow the definition of a continuum measure of deformation, and (2) the almost inevitable shear band localization. These problems exist in both real-world granular materials and their numerical idealizations using particle-based simulations. In this work a new method is developed in order to address these issues. Instead of creating a meshed equivalent continuum for quantifying small engineering strains, the new method performs independent random queries on the velocity gradient characteristics of arbitrary sub-domains in the assembly through the novel concept of overlapping reference triangles, thus, enabling rigorous handling of large deformations which are usually associated with localization. The proposed method is illustrated and validated by discrete element method (DEM) simulation of a biaxial compressive test, in which apparent shear banding takes place. The homogenized deformation quantifications based on the new method match the estimations from the imposed boundary conditions. The numerical examples are also applied to (1) quantifying the heterogeneous distribution of deformation over the specimen, (2) visualizing the nucleation process of shear bands, and (3) characterizing shear flow patterns in shear bands. An investigation on the effects of the reference triangle sizes yields some inspiring and practically significant results. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here, gauge-invariance denotes invariance under diffeomorphic reparametrizations of the reference configuration, suitably adapted to the geometrically linear setting. The model features a defect energy contribution which is quadratic in the tensor {\$}inc(\backslashepsilon{\_}p){\$} and it contains isotropic hardening based on the rate of the symmetric infinitesimal plastic strain tensor {\$}\backslashdot{\{}\backslashepsilon{\_}p{\}}{\$}. We motivate the new model by introducing a novel rotational invariance requirement in gradient plasticity, which we call micro-randomness, suitable for the description of polycrystalline aggregates on a mesoscopic scale and not coinciding with classical isotropy requirements. This new condition effectively reduces the increments of the non-symmetric infinitesimal plastic distortion {\$}\backslashdot{\{}p{\}}{\$} to their symmetric counterpart {\$}\backslashdot{\{}\backslashepsilon{\_}p{\}}{\$}. In the polycrystalline case, this condition is a statement about insensitivity to arbitrary superposed grain rotations. We formulate a mathematical existence result for a suitably regularized non-gauge-invariant model. The regularized model is rather invariant under reparametrizations of the reference configuration including infinitesimal conformal mappings.},

It has been known that Navier–Stokes equations are incapable of explaining the phenomena at micro and nano scales. On the contrary, MFD can naturally pick up the physical phenomena at micro and nano scales owingto its additional degrees of freedom for gyration. In this study, the analyti- cal and exact solutions of Couette and Hagen–Poiseuille flow are provided. Though this study is limited to the steady flow cases, the unsteady term in the MFD has been taken into account. This present work initiates the development of a general-purpose code of computa- tional micropolar fluid dynamics (CMFD).

Disequilibrium among the three components of temperature, namely, the difference between the kinetic temperature in the direction of a planar shock wave and those in the transverse directions, particularly in the region near the shock front, gives rise to a new transport (equilibration) mechanism not seen in usual one-dimensional heat-flow situations. The modification of the heat-flow equation was tested earlier for the case of strong shock waves in the ideal gas, which had been studied in the past and compared to Navier-Stokes-Fourier solutions. Now, the Lennard-Jones fluid, whose equation of state and transport properties have been determined from independent calculations, allows us to study the case where potential, as well as kinetic contributions are important. The new heat-flow treatment improves the agreement with nonequilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations under strong shock wave conditions, compared to Navier-Stokes.},

abstract = {The yield stress characteristic is a property associated with numerous types of complex fl uids – whereby the material does not fl ow unless the applied stress exceeds a certain value. This is evident in everyday tasks such as squeezing toothpaste from a tube or dispensing ketchup from a bottle, but is important across a whole range of industries and applications. The determination of a yield stress as a true material constant can be diffi cult as the measured value can be very much dependent on the measurement technique employed and the conditions of the test, of which there are many. Consequently, there is no universal method for determining yield stress and there exist a number of approaches, which find favour across different industries and establishments. This White Paper discusses the various approaches available to measure yield stress, and aspects of the practical measurement set-up and test parameters that need to be considered to obtain relevant, robust and reliable yield stress data using a rotational rheometer.},

Such an approach rests on the universality of free-fall--the weak equivalence principle--and would break down without it. On the other hand, the teleparallel version of general relativity, a gauge theory for the translation group, describes the gravitational interaction by a force similar to the Lorentz force of electromagnetism, a non-universal interaction. It is shown that, similarly to the Maxwell's description of electromagnetism, the teleparallel gauge approach provides a consistent theory for gravitation even in the absence of the weak equivalence principle.},

@article{Muller1999,
abstract = {The Navier-Stokes-Fourier theory of viscous, heat-conducting fluids provides parabolic equations and thus predicts infinite pulse speeds. Naturally this feature has disqualified the theory for relativistic thermodynamics which must insist on finite speeds and, moreover, on speeds smaller than c. The attempts at a remedy have proved heuristically important for a new systematic type of thermodynamics: Extended thermodynamics. That new theory has symmetric hyperbolic field equations and thus it provides finite pulse speeds. Extended thermodynamics is a whole hierarchy of theories with an increasing number of fields when gradients and rates of thermodynamic processes become steeper and faster. The first stage in this hierarchy is the 14-field theory which may already be a useful tool for the relativist in many applications. The 14 fields - and further fields - are conveniently chosen from the moments of the kinetic theory of gases. The hierarchy is complete only when the number of fields tends to infinity. In that case the pulse speed of non-relativistic extended thermodynamics tends to infinity while the pulse speed of relativistic extended thermodynamics tends to c, the speed of light. In extended thermodynamics symmetric hyperbolicity - and finite speeds - are implied by the concavity of the entropy density. This is still true in relativistic thermodynamics for a privileged entropy density which is the entropy density of the rest frame for non-degenerate gases.},

abstract = {Viscosity and magnetic fields drive differentially rotating stars toward uniform rotation, which has important consequences in many astrophysical contexts. For example, merging binary neutron stars can form a "hypermassive" remnant, i.e. a differentially rotating star with a mass greater than the maximum allowed by uniform rotation. The removal of the centrifugal support provided by differential rotation can lead to delayed collapse of the remnant to a black hole, accompanied by a burst of gravitational radiation. Both magnetic fields and viscosity alter the structure of differentially rotating stars on secular timescales, making numerical tracking of the evolution difficult. Here, we present the first simulations of rapidly rotating stars with shear viscosity in full general relativity. We self-consistently include viscosity in our relativistic hydrodynamic code to solve the relativistic Navier-Stokes equations both in axisymmetry and in full 3+1 dimensions. In axisymmetry, we follow secular evolution with high resolution over dozens of rotation periods (thousands of M). We find that viscosity operating in a hypermassive star generically leads to the formation of a compact, uniformly rotating core surrounded by a low-density disk. These uniformly rotating cores are often, but not always, unstable to gravitational collapse. In the unstable cases, we follow the collapse and determine the mass and the spin of the final black hole and ambient disk. In all cases studied, the rest mass of the resulting disk is found to be 10-20{\%} of the original star, whether surrounding a uniformly rotating core or a rotating black hole. This study foreshadows more detailed, future simulations of secular processes, including magnetic effects, in relativistic stars.},

@article{Launder1989,
abstract = {The paper summarizes the present position of second-moment closure and outlines possible directions for future development. It is first argued that a simple form of second-moment treatment that has been widely used for computing industrial flows gives demonstrably superior predictive accuracy that any eddy-viscosity model. More complex schemes, now in the final phases of development, that exactly satisfy various limiting constraints, give a further marked improvement in our ability to mimic the response of turbulence to external inputs. The inclusion of such models into commercial software over the next few years is quite feasible. The desirability of introducing a further second-rank tensor into the closure is considered; the conclusion reached is that, for most applications, the likely benefits would not justify the additional effort. The split-spectrum approach may, however, be attractive for certain flows with unusual spectral distributions of energy. The introduction of a second scale-related equation is arguably a more sensible approach since the extra computational cost is small while the added flexibility could bring significant benefits in modeling turbulence far from equilibrium. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

This difference is most prominent near the shock front. We test our heat-flow equation for the case of strong shock waves in the ideal gas, which has been studied in the past and compared to Navier-Stokes solutions. The new heat-flow treatment improves the agreement with nonequilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations of hard spheres under strong shockwave conditions.},

With the energy and entropy functions being frame invariant, the stress tensor expression as obtained in terms of F satisfies the principle of material frame indifference. As an alternative to the F-formulation, it is also shown how elasticity can be described in terms of the mass density and the isochoric deformation gradient, over(F, ̃) = F / root(det F, 3), instead. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

One of the key features of these new equations is that - in contrast to the original log-conf equations given by Fattal and Kupferman (2004) - these constitutive equations combined with the Navier-Stokes equations constitute a self-contained, non-iterative system of partial differential equations. In addition to its potential as a fruitful source for understanding the mathematical subtleties of the models from a new perspective, this analytical description also allows us to fully utilize the Newton-Raphson algorithm in numerical simulations, which by design should lead to reduced computational effort. By means of the confined cylinder benchmark we will show that a finite element discretization of these new equations delivers results of comparable accuracy to known methods.},

The scheme is applied to the lid driven cavity problem for Knudsen numbers up to 0.7. The results compare well with those obtained from more costly solvers for rarefied gas dynamics, such as the Integro Moment Method (IMM) and the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The R13 equations yield better results than the classical Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations for this boundary value problem, since they give an approximate description of Knudsen boundary layers at moderate Knudsen numbers. The R13 based numerical solutions are computationally economical and may be considered as a reliable alternative mathematical model for complex industrial problems at moderate Knudsen numbers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The result is compared with previous works where these later coefficients were neglected and viscosity variables were not assumed to satisfy causal transport equations. Prospective applica-tions of this result to some astrophysical scenarios are discussed.},

abstract = {General Relativity theory is reviewed following the vierbein field theory approach proposed in 1928 by Einstein. It is based on the vierbein field taken as the "square root" of the metric tensor field. Einstein's vierbein theory is a gauge field theory for gravity; the vierbein field playing the role of a gauge field but not exactly like the vector potential field does in Yang-Mills theory--the correction to the derivative (the covariant derivative) is not proportional to the vierbein field as it would be if gravity were strictly a Yang-Mills theory. Einstein discovered the spin connection in terms of the vierbein fields to take the place of the conventional affine connection. To date, one of the most important applications of the vierbein representation is for the derivation of the correction to a 4-spinor quantum field transported in curved space, yielding the correct form of the covariant derivative. Thus, the vierbein field theory is the most natural way to represent a relativistic quantum field theory in curved space. Using the vierbein field theory, presented is a derivation of the the Einstein equation and then the Dirac equation in curved space. Einstein's original 1928 manuscripts translated into English are included.},

abstract = {In the generation of plane waves in metal plates by detonation of contact explosives, the pressures reached can be sufficiently high to produce finite elastic and plastic strain components, and appreciable changes in temperature due to thermomechanical coupling effects. A theory of elastic - plastic deformation is developed to include these conditions. Finite elastic and plastic deformations are represented in terms of the initial and final configurations of the body, and an unstressed configuration subject only to plastic flow. In general, this configuration cannot be represented by a continuous displacement function. The analysis of the kinematics of these three states is carried out for general deformation history. The discussion of the application of finite deformation thermoelastic theory is limited to the conditions in a plane wave with fixed principal directions. Plasticity theory with the consideration of variable temperature is also restricted to the plane-wave situation. The influence of the thermodynamic irreversibility of plastic flow is included in an entropy production term which modifies the temperature variation. Application to the plane-wave propagation problem is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1967 The American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A fully relativistic formulation of the concept of a perfectly elastic solid is developed with a view to application to such problems as (a) the interaction of gravitational radiation with planetary type bodies such as the Earth, and (b) the vibrations and deformations of neutron star crusts. For applications of the former kind a low-pressure Hookean idealization (i.e. a theory postulating a linear stress-strain relation) will often be sufficient. A prototype version of a relativistic Hookean theory suitable for this purpose has already been given by Rayner (1963), but it will be shown that Rayner's theory needs minor corrections in order to be strictly self consistent. For applications to neutron stars a purely Hookean theory will in any case be inadequate and to replace it a high-pressure quasi-Hookean idealization is described. This idealization includes the important special case of the perfect (i.e. isotropic) solid in which the elastic properties may be described in terms of just two (nonlinear) functions of state, namely the pressure and the modulus of rigidity. The theory reduces to the familiar perfect fluid idealization in the limit when the modulus of rigidity is zero. The discussion is conceptually based on the use of two distinct manifolds: a four-dimensional manifold [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} of space-time events, with a fundamental pseudo-Riemannian metric, and a three-dimensional manifold [IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} of idealized particles, with a fundamental measure representing a conserved particle number density.

abstract = {New classes of modified teleparallel theories of gravity are introduced. The action of this theory is constructed to be a function of the irreducible parts of torsion f(Tax,Tten,Tvec), where Tax,Tten and Tvec are squares of the axial, tensor and vector components of torsion, respectively. This is the most general (well-motivated) second order teleparallel theory of gravity that can be constructed from the torsion tensor. Different particular second order theories can be recovered from this theory such as new general relativity, conformal teleparallel gravity or f(T) gravity. Additionally, the boundary term B which connects the Ricci scalar with the torsion scalar via R=−T+B can also be incorporated into the action. By performing a conformal transformation, it is shown that the two unique theories which have an Einstein frame are either the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity or f(−T+B)=f(R) gravity, as expected.},

abstract = {A well-established numerical approach to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids is Chorin's projection method [1], whereby the fluid velocity is explicitly updated, and then an elliptic problem for the pressure is solved, which is used to orthogonally project the velocity field to maintain the incompressibility constraint. In this paper, we develop a mathematical correspondence between Newtonian fluids in the incompressible limit and hypo-elastoplastic solids in the slow, quasi-static limit. Using this correspondence, we formulate a new fixed-grid, Eulerian numerical method for simulating quasi-static hypo-elastoplastic solids, whereby the stress is explicitly updated, and then an elliptic problem for the velocity is solved, which is used to orthogonally project the stress to maintain the quasi-staticity constraint. We develop a finite-difference implementation of the method and apply it to an elasto-viscoplastic model of a bulk metallic glass based on the shear transformation zone theory. We show that in a two-dimensional plane strain simple shear simulation, the method is in quantitative agreement with an explicit method. Like the fluid projection method, it is efficient and numerically robust, making it practical for a wide variety of applications. We also demonstrate that the method can be extended to simulate objects with evolving boundaries. We highlight a number of correspondences between incompressible fluid mechanics and quasi-static elastoplasticity, creating possibilities for translating other numerical methods between the two classes of physical problems.},

In Sec.$\backslash$ 3, experimental results with neutron interferometers in the gravitational field of the earth, as inter- preted by means of the equivalence principle, can be predicted by means of the Dirac equation in an accelerated and rotating reference frame. Using the Dirac equation in such a non-inertial frame, we describe how in a gauge- theoretical approach (see Table 1) the Einstein-Cartan theory, residing in a Riemann-Cartan spacetime encompassing torsion and curvature, arises as the simplest gravitational theory. This is set in contrast to the Einsteinian approach yielding general relativity in a Riemannian spacetime. In Secs.$\backslash$ 4 and 5 we consider the conserved energy-momentum current of matter and gauge the associated translation subgroup. The Einsteinian teleparallelism theory which emerges is shown to be equivalent, for spinless matter and for electromagnetism, to general relativity. Having successfully gauged the translations, it is straightforward to gauge the four-dimensional affine group {\$}R{\^{}}4 \backslashsemidirect GL(4,R){\$} or its Poincar$\backslash$'e subgroup {\$}R{\^{}}4\backslashsemidirect SO(1,3){\$}. We briefly report on these results in Sec.$\backslash$ 6 (metric-affine geometry) and in Sec.$\backslash$ 7 (metric-affine field equations ($\backslash$ref{\{}zeroth{\}}, $\backslash$ref{\{}first{\}}, $\backslash$ref{\{}second{\}})). Finally, in Sec.$\backslash$ 8, we collect some models, currently under discussion, which bring life into the metric-affine gauge framework developed.},

abstract = {Novae and coronae are large volcanotectonic features on Venus, with a contentious and possibly non-unique origin and enigmatic relationship. Their formation is most commonly explained by flexure and fracturing of the strong rigid Venus lithosphere atop mantle upwelling and/or downwelling. Here we present new 3D high-resolution thermomechanical model of mantle plume/diapir impingement into warm and thin lithosphere with Venus-like surface temperature. Numerical results suggests that nova-like and corona-like structures can result from magma-assisted convection of weak ductile crust, induced by decompression melting of the hot rising mantle plume. During the initial stage, nova forms by stellate fracturing of a topographic rise forming atop the growing crustal convection cell. Few million years later, nova can convert to coronae by inward dipping concentric fracturing of the nova rise margins and subsequent outward thrusting of partially molten crustal rocks over the surface. An outer annulus of concentric normal faults forms in the outer rise region of the downbending brittle upper crust, whereas an inner annulus of concentric thrust faults forms in front of the outward thrusting crustal wedge. A trench-like depression forms between these two annuli. Resembling retreating subduction, the rudimentary concentric upper-crustal slab warms up rapidly and recycles into the convection cell. The convection cell remains active for up to 15 million years, fueled by heat and magma from the plume. Predicted surface topography and fracturing patterns agree with some small to moderate size novae and coronae on Venus. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss various formats of gradient elasticity and their performance in static and dynamic applications. Gradient elasticity theories provide extensions of the classical equations of elasticity with additional higher-order spatial derivatives of strains, stresses and/or accelerations. We focus on the versatile class of gradient elasticity theories whereby the higher-order terms are the Laplacian of the corresponding lower-order terms. One of the challenges of formulating gradient elasticity theories is to keep the number of additional constitutive parameters to a minimum. We start with discussing the general Mindlin theory, that in its most general form has 903 constitutive elastic parameters but which were reduced by Mindlin to three independent material length scales. Further simplifications are often possible. In particular, the Aifantis theory has only one additional parameter in statics and opens up a whole new field of analytical and numerical solution procedures. We also address how this can be extended to dynamics. An overview of length scale identification and quantification procedures is given. Finite element implementations of the most commonly used versions of gradient elasticity are discussed together with the variationally consistent boundary conditions. Details are provided for particular formats of gradient elasticity that can be implemented with simple, linear finite element shape functions. New numerical results show the removal of singularities in statics and dynamics, as well as the size-dependent mechanical response predicted by gradient elasticity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Various physical interfacial phenomena occur during the process of welding and influence the final properties of welded structures. As the features of such interfaces depend on physics that resolve at different spatial scales, a multiscale and multiphysics numerical modeling approach is necessary. In a collaborative research project Modeling of Interface Evolution in Advanced Welding, a novel strategy of model linking is employed in a multiscale, multiphysics computational framework for fusion welding. We only directly link numerical models that are on neighboring spatial scales instead of trying to link all submodels directly together through all available spatial scales. This strategy ensures that the numerical models assist one another via smooth data transfer, avoiding the huge difficulty raised by forcing models to attempt communication over many spatial scales. Experimental activities contribute to the modeling work by providing valuable input parameters and validation data. Representative examples of the results of modeling, linking and characterization are presented. ? 2012 TMS.},

We discuss the gradient expansion, the phenomenon of hydrodynamization, as well as several models of hydrodynamic evolution equations, highlighting the interplay between collective long-lived and transient modes in relativistic matter. Our aim to provide a unified presentation of this vast subject -- which is naturally expressed in diverse mathematical languages -- has also led us to include several new results on the large-order behaviour of the hydrodynamic gradient{\~{}}expansion.},

@article{Bilby1955,
abstract = {When describing a crystal containing an arbitrary distribution of dislocation lines it is often convenient to treat the distribution as continuous, and to specify the state of dislocation as a function of position. Formally, however, there is then no ‘good crystal' anywhere, and difficulties arise in defining Burgers circuits and the dislocation tensor. The dislocated state may be defined precisely by relating the local basis at each point to that of a reference lattice. The dislocation density may then be defined; it is important to distinguish this from the local dislocation density. The geometry of the continuously dislocated crystal is most conveniently analyzed by treating the manifold of lattice points in the final state as a non-Riemannian one with a single asymmetric connexion. The coefficients of connexion may be expressed in terms of the generating deformations relating the dislocated crystal to the reference lattice. The tensor defining the local dislocation density is then the torsion tensor associated with the asymmetric connexion. Some properties of the connexion are briefly discussed and it is shown that it possesses that of distant parallelism, in conformity with the requirement that the dislocated lattice be everywhere unique.},

abstract = {We study dark solitons, namely density dips with a phase jump across the density minimum, in a one-dimensional, weakly lossy nonlinear acoustic metamaterial, composed of a waveguide featuring a periodic array of side holes. Relying on the electroacoustic analogy and the transmission line approach, we derive a lattice model which, in the continuum approximation, leads to a nonlinear, dispersive and dissipative wave equation. The latter, using the method of multiple scales, is reduced to a defocusing nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, which leads to dark soliton solutions. The dissipative dynamics of these structures is studied via soliton perturbation theory. We investigate the role-and interplay between-nonlinearity, dispersion and dissipation on the soliton formation and dynamics. Our analytical predictions are corroborated by direct numerical simulations.},

abstract = {We study capillary trapping in porous media using direct pore-scale simulation of two-phase flow on micro-CT images of a Berea sandstone and a sandpack. The trapped non-wetting phase saturations are predicted by solving the full Navier–Stokes equations using a volume-of-fluid based finite-volume framework to simulate primary drainage followed by water injection. Using these simulations, we analyse the effects of initial non-wetting-phase saturation, capillary number and flow direction on the residual saturation. The predictions from our numerical method are in agreement with published experimental measurements of capillary trapping curves. This shows that our direct simulation method can be used to elucidate the effect of pore structure and flow pattern of capillary trapping and provides a platform to study the physics of multiphase flow at the pore scale.},

abstract = {Granular flows occur widely in nature and industry, yet a continuum description that captures their important features is yet not at hand. Recent experiments on granular materials sheared in a cylindrical Couette device revealed a puzzling anomaly, wherein all components of the stress rise nearly exponentially with depth. Here we show, using particle dynamics simulations and imaging experiments, that the stress anomaly arises from a remarkable vortex flow. For the entire range of fill heights explored, we observe a single toroidal vortex that spans the entire Couette cell and whose sense is opposite to the uppermost Taylor vortex in a fluid. We show that the vortex is driven by a combination of shear-induced dilation, a phenomenon that has no analogue in fluids, and gravity flow. Dilatancy is an important feature of granular mechanics, but not adequately incorporated in existing models.},

                     , so far no methods exist to altogether eliminate turbulence if velocities are sufficiently large. We demonstrate for pipe flow that appropriate distortions to the velocity profile lead to a complete collapse of turbulence and subsequently friction losses are reduced by as much as 90{\%}. Counterintuitively, the return to laminar motion is accomplished by initially increasing turbulence intensities or by transiently amplifying wall shear. Since neither the Reynolds number nor the shear stresses decrease (the latter often increase), these measures are not indicative of turbulence collapse. Instead, an amplification mechanism
                        4,5
                      measuring the interaction between eddies and the mean shear is found to set a threshold below which turbulence is suppressed beyond recovery.},

abstract = {The Boltzmann equation is often used to model rarefied gas flow in the transition or kinetic regime for moderate to large Knudsen numbers. However, standard moment methods like Grad's approach lack hyperbolicity of the equations. We point out the failure of Grad's method and overcome the deficiencies with the help of the new hyperbolic moment models called QBME and HME, derived by an operator projection framework.
The new model equations are in partially-conservative form meaning that a subset of the equations cannot be written in conservative form due to some changes in these equations. This leads to additional numerical difficulties. The influence of the partially-conservative terms on the solution is analyzed and we present a numerical scheme for the solution of the partially-conservative PDE systems, namely the PRICE-C scheme by Canestrelli. Furthermore, a shock structure test case is used to compare the accuracy of the different hyperbolic moment models to a discrete velocity reference solution.
The results show that the new hyperbolic models achieve higher accuracy than the standard Grad model despite the fact that the model equations cannot be fully written in conservative form.},

@article{Wetzel1999,
abstract = {Fluid-fluid mixtures often possess a fine structure, or morphology, whose length scale is much smaller than the length scale over which the flow field and morphology vary. We define a microstructural variable called the area tensor, which describes the local morphology of such mixtures through volume-averaged size, shape, and orientation characteristics. The area tensor is equivalent to the interface tensor of the rheological model, and is closely related to the general microstructural tensors. The evolution equation for the area tensor during laminar mixing is derived for the case of equal component viscosities and negligible surface tension. Solution of this evolution equation requires a closure approximation for estimating higher-order microstructural statistics. A closure approximation is generated based on exact area tensor relations for ellipsoidal shapes, and is shown to provide highly accurate evolutions of the area tensor. Area tensor histories are calculated in homogeneous elongational and shearing flows, as well as in temporally and spatially varying flows. The results are shown to be consistent with well-known mixing principles.},

abstract = {The normal impact of a drop of yield-stress fluid on a flat rigid surface is investigated experimentally. Using different model fluids (polymer microgels, clay suspensions) and impacted surfaces (partially wettable, super-hydrophobic), we find a rich variety of impact regimes from irreversible viscoplastic coating to giant elastic spreading and recoil. A minimal model of inertial spreading, taking into account an elasto-viscoplastic rheology, allows explaining in a single framework the different regimes and scaling laws. In addition, semi-quantitative predictions for the spread factor are obtained when the measured rheological parameters of the fluid (elasticity, yield stress, viscosity) are injected into the model. Our study offers a means to probe the short-time rheology of yield-stress fluids and highlights the role of elasticity on the unsteady hydrodynamics of these complex fluids. Movies are available with the online version of the paper (go to journals.cambridge.org/flm).},

The main physical assumptions that underlie this theory are described. We clarify the physical meaning and significance of Weitzenb{\"{o}}ck's torsion, and emphasize its intimate relationship with the gravitational field, characterized by the Riemannian curvature of spacetime. In this theory, nonlocality can simulate dark matter; in fact, in the Newtonian regime, we recover the phenomenological Tohline-Kuhn approach to modified gravity. To account for the observational data regarding dark matter, nonlocality is associated with a characteristic length scale of order 1 kpc. The confrontation of nonlocal gravity with observation is briefly discussed.},

This expression is used to determine the properties of a flat interface between two coexisting phases. In particular, we find that the thickness of the interface increases with increasing temperature and becomes infinite at the critical temperature Tc, and that at a temperature T just below Tc the interfacial free energy $\sigma$ is proportional to (Tc−Tmath. The predicted interfacial free energy and its temperature dependence are found to be in agreement with existing experimental data. The possibility of using optical measurements of the interface thickness to provide an additional check of our treatment is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss some applications of the classical Gibbs adsorption equation to speci c di¬use interface models that are based on conserved and non-conserved order parameters. Such models are natural examples of the general methodology developed by J. W. Gibbs in his treatment of the thermodynamics of surfaces. We employ the methodology of J.W. Cahn, which avoids the use of conventional dividing surfaces to de ne surface excess quantities. We show that the Gibbs adsorption equation holds for systems with gradient energy coe¯ cients, provided the appropriate de nitions of surface excess quantities are used.We consider, in particular, the phase-  eld model of a binary alloy with gradient energy coe¯ cients for solute and the phase  eld. We derive a solute surface excess quantity that is independent of a dividing surface convention, and  nd that the adsorption in this model is in{\textregistered}uenced by the surface free energies of the pure components of the binary alloy as well as the solute gradient energy coe¯ cient. We present one-dimensional numerical solutions for this model corresponding to a stationary planar interface and show the consistency of the numerical results with the Gibbs adsorption equation. We also discuss the Gibbs adsorption equation in the context of other di¬use interface models that arise in spinodal decomposition and order{\{}disorder transitions.}},

@article{Meier2017,
abstract = {Among the many additive manufacturing (AM) processes for metallic materials, selective laser melting (SLM) is arguably the most versatile in terms of its potential to realize complex geometries along with tailored microstructure. However, the complexity of the SLM process, and the need for predictive relation of powder and process parameters to the part properties, demands further development of computational and experimental methods. This review addresses the fundamental physical phenomena of SLM, with a special emphasis on the associated thermal behavior. Simulation and experimental methods are discussed according to three primary categories. First, macroscopic approaches aim to answer questions at the component level and consider for example the determination of residual stresses or dimensional distortion effects prevalent in SLM. Second, mesoscopic approaches focus on the detection of defects such as excessive surface roughness, residual porosity or inclusions that occur at the mesoscopic length scale of individual powder particles. Third, microscopic approaches investigate the metallurgical microstructure evolution resulting from the high temperature gradients and extreme heating and cooling rates induced by the SLM process. Consideration of physical phenomena on all of these three length scales is mandatory to establish the understanding needed to realize high part quality in many applications, and to fully exploit the potential of SLM and related metal AM processes.},

The evaporation coefficient is the problem parameter and may take arbitrary values within the limits from zero to unity. The problem is formulated for the kinetic equation and solved by the finite-difference method. It is shown that a deviation of the evaporation coefficient from unity considerably modifies the gas phase flow pattern. However, the evaporation rate divided by the rate of evaporation into a vacuum at the given surface temperature is only weakly dependent on the evaporation coefficient.},

Israel-Stewart theory is a stable and causal description of dissipation in relativistic hydrodynamics although it includes relaxation process with the timescale for collision of constituent particles, which introduces stiff equations and makes practical numerical calculation difficult. In our new scheme, we use Strang's splitting method, and use the piecewise exact solutions for solving the extremely short timescale problem. In addition, since we split the calculations into inviscid step and dissipative step, Riemann solver can be used for obtaining numerical flux for the inviscid step. The use of Riemann solver enables us to capture shocks very accurately. Simple numerical examples are shown. The present scheme can be applied to various high energy phenomena of astrophysics and nuclear physics. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Hehl2007a,
abstract = {We review the application of torsion in field theory. First we show how the notion of torsion emerges in differential geometry. In the context of a Cartan circuit, torsion is related to translations similar as curvature to rotations. Cartan's investigations started by analyzing Einsteins general relativity theory and by taking recourse to the theory of Cosserat continua. In these continua, the points of which carry independent translational and rotational degrees of freedom, there occur, besides ordinary (force) stresses, additionally spin moment stresses. In a 3-dimensional "continuized" (Kr{\"{o}}ner) crystal with dislocation lines, a linear connection can be introduced that takes the crystal lattice structure as a basis for parallelism. Such a continuum has similar properties as a Cosserat continuum, and the dislocation density is equal to the torsion of this connection. Subsequently, these ideas are applied to 4-dimensional spacetime. A translational gauge theory of gravity is displayed (in a Weitzenb{\"{o}}ck or teleparallel spacetime) as well as the viable Einstein-Cartan theory (in a Riemann-Cartan spacetime). In both theories, the notion of torsion is contained in an essential way. Cartan's spiral staircase is described as a 3-dimensional Euclidean model for a space with torsion, and eventually some controversial points are discussed regarding the meaning of torsion.},

@article{Smith2016,
abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) methods for rapid prototyping of 3D materials (3D printing) have become increasingly popular with a particular recent emphasis on those methods used for metallic materials. These processes typically involve an accumulation of cyclic phase changes. The widespread interest in these methods is largely stimulated by their unique ability to create components of considerable complexity. However, modeling such processes is exceedingly difficult due to the highly localized and drastic material evolution that often occurs over the course of the manufacture time of each component. Final product characterization and validation are currently driven primarily by experimental means as a result of the lack of robust modeling procedures. In the present work, the authors discuss primary detrimental hurdles that have plagued effective modeling of AM methods for metallic materials while also providing logical speculation into preferable research directions for overcoming these hurdles. The primary focus of this work encompasses the specific areas of high-performance computing, multiscale modeling, materials characterization, process modeling, experimentation, and validation for final product performance of additively manufactured metallic components.},

Phys., Vol. 255, 2013, pp 680-698] originally constructed for solving the BGK equation, to the more challenging case of the Boltzmann equation. The scheme combines a robust and fast method for treating the transport part based on an innovative Lagrangian technique supplemented with fast spectral schemes to treat the collisional operator by means of an operator splitting approach. This approach along with several implementation features related to the parallelization of the algorithm permits to construct an efficient simulation tool which is numerically tested against exact and reference solutions on classical problems arising in rarefied gas dynamic. We present results up to the 3D×3D case for unsteady flows for the Variable Hard Sphere model which may serve as benchmark for future comparisons between different numerical methods for solving the multidimensional Boltzmann equation. For this reason, we also provide for each problem studied details on the computational cost and memory consumption as well as comparisons with the BGK model or the limit model of compressible Euler equations.},

abstract = {We derive conservation and balance laws for the translational gauge theory of dislocations by applying Noether's theorem. We present an improved translational gauge theory of dislocations including the dislocation density tensor and the dislocation current tensor. The invariance of the variational principle under the continuous group of transformations is studied. Through Lie's-infinitesimal invariance criterion we obtain conserved translational and rotational currents for the total Lagrangian made up of an elastic and dislocation part. We calculate the broken scaling current. Looking only on one part of the whole system, the conservation laws are changed into balance laws. Because of the lack of translational, rotational and dilatation invariance for each part, a configurational force, moment and power appears. The corresponding J, L and M integrals are obtained. Only isotropic and homogeneous materials are considered and we restrict ourselves to a linear theory. We choose constitutive laws for the most general linear form of material isotropy. Also we give the conservation and balance laws corresponding to the gauge symmetry and the addition of solutions. From the addition of solutions we derive a reciprocity theorem for the gauge theory of dislocations. Also, we derive the conservation laws for stress-free states of dislocations.},

@book{Russel1992,
abstract = {The book covers the physical side of colloid science from the individual forces acting between submicron particles suspended in a liquid through the resulting equilibrium and dynamic properties. The relevant forces include Brownian motion, electrostatic repulsion, dispersion attraction, both attraction and repulsion due to soluble polymer, and viscous forces due to relative motion between the particles and the liquid. The balance among Brownian motion and the interparticle forces decides the questions of stability and phase behavior. Imposition of external fields produces complex effects, i.e. electrokinetic phenomena (electric field), sedimentation (gravitational field), diffusion (concentration/chemical potential gradient), and non-Newtonian rheology (shear field). The treatment aims to impart a sound, quantitative understanding based on fundamental theory and experiments with well-characterized model systems. This broad grasp of the fundamentals lends insight and helps to develop the intuitive sense needed to isolate essential features of technological problems and design critical experiments. Some exposure to fluid mechanics, statistical mechanics, and electricity and magnetism is assumed, but each subject is reintroduced in a self-contained manner.},

abstract = {Variationally consistent phase-field methods have been well established in the recent decade. A wide range of applications to brittle and ductile fracture problems could already demonstrate the ability to predict complex crack patterns in three-dimensional geometries. However, current phase-field models to ductile fracture are not formulated for both, material and geometrical non-linearities. In this contribution we present a computational framework to account for three-dimensional fracture in ductile solids undergoing large elastic and plastic deformations. The proposed model is based on a triple multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient and an exponential update scheme for the return map in the time discrete setting. This increases the accuracy on the entire range of the ductile material behavior encompassing elastoplasticity, hardening, necking, crack initiation and propagation. The accuracy and convergence properties are further improved by the application of a higher order phase-field regularization and a gradient enhanced plasticity model. To account for the ductile behavior at fracture, a model of the critical fracture energy density depending on the equivalent plastic strain is proposed and validated by experimental data.},

abstract = {The Navier-Stokes Hamiltonian is derived from first principles. Its Hamilton equations are shown to be equivalent to the continuity, Navier-Stokes, and energy conservation equations of a compressible viscous fluid. The derivations of the Euler and Navier-Stokes Hamiltonians are compared, with the former having identical dynamics to the Euler equation with the viscosity terms of the Navier-Stokes equation dropped from the beginning. The two Hamiltonians have the same number of degrees of freedom in three spatial and one temporal dimension: six independent scalar potentials, but their dynamical fields are necessarily different due to a theory with dissipation not mapping smoothly onto one without. The dynamical coordinate field of a dissipative fluid is a vector field that stores the initial position of all of its fluid particles. Thus these appear to be natural coordinates for studying arbitrary separations of fluid particles over time. The classical similarity renormalization group is introduced and the first steps are carried out deriving a flow equation for the Navier-Stokes Hamiltonian. Finally, the symmetries of a nonrelativistic viscous fluid are discussed through its galilean algebra with dissipative canonical Poisson brackets.},

abstract = {In the present work fluid flow and solute transport through porous media are described by solving the governing equations at the pore scale with finite-volume discretization. Instead of solving the simplified Stokes equation (very often employed in this context) the full Navier-Stokes equation is used here. The realistic three-dimensional porous medium is created in this work by packing together, with standard ballistic physics, irregular and polydisperse objects. Emphasis is placed on numerical issues related to mesh generation and spatial discretization, which play an important role in determining the final accuracy of the finite-volume scheme and are often overlooked. The simulations performed are then analyzed in terms of velocity distributions and dispersion rates in a wider range of operating conditions, when compared with other works carried out by solving the Stokes equation. Results show that dispersion within the analyzed porous medium is adequately described by classical power laws obtained by analytic homogenization. Eventually the validity of Fickian diffusion to treat dispersion in porous media is also assessed. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Experiments have shown that the failure loads of Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) devices usually exhibit a considerable level of variability, which is believed to be caused by the random material strength and the geometry-induced random stress field. Understanding the strength statistics of MEMS devices is of paramount importance for the device design guarding against a tolerable failure risk. In this study, we develop a continuum-based probabilistic model for polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) MEMS structures within the framework of first passage analysis. The failure of poly-Si MEMS structures is considered to be triggered by fracture initiation from the sidewalls governed by a nonlocal failure criterion. The model takes into account an autocorrelated random field of material tensile strength. The nonlocal random stress field is obtained by stochastic finite element simulations based on the information of the uncertainties of the sidewall geometry. The model is formulated within the contexts of both stationary and non-stationary stochastic processes for MEMS structures of various geometries and under different loading configurations. It is shown that the model agrees well with the experimentally measured strength distributions of uniaxial tensile poly-Si MEMS specimens of different gauge lengths. The model is further used to predict the strength distribution of poly-Si MEMS beams under three-point bending, and the result is compared with the Monte Carlo simulation. The present model predicts strong size effects on both the strength distribution and the mean structural strength. It is shown that the mean size effect curve consists of three power-law asymptotes in the small, intermediate, and large-size regimes. By matching these three asymptotes, an approximate size effect equation is proposed. The present model is shown to be a generalization of the classical weakest-link statistical model, and it provides a physical interpretation of the material length scale used in the weakest-link model.},

We consider a spacetime region whose boundary has piecewise {\$}C{\^{}}2{\$} components, each of which can be spacelike, timelike or null and consider metric variations in which only the pullback of the metric to the boundary is held fixed. Allowing all such metric variations we present a unified treatment of the spacelike, timelike and null boundary components using Cartan's tetrad formalism. Apart from its computational simplicity, this formalism gives us a simple way of identifying corner terms. We also discuss "creases" which occur when the boundary is the event horizon of a black hole. Our treatment is geometric and intrinsic and we present our results both in the computationally simpler tetrad formalism as well as the more familiar metric formalism. We recover known results from a simpler and more general point of view and find some new ones.},

abstract = {We discuss the appearance of time-asymmetric behavior in physical processes in cosmology and in the dynamics of the Universe itself. We begin with an analysis of the nature and origin of irreversibility in well-known physical processes such as dispersion, diffusion, dissipation and mixing, and make the distinction between processes whose irreversibility arises from the stipulation of special initial conditions, and those arising from the system's interaction with a coarse-grained environment. We then study the irreversibility associated with quantum fluctuations in cosmological processes like particle creation and the `birth of the Universe'. We suggest that the backreaction effect of such quantum processes can be understood as the manifestation of a fluctuation-dissipation relation relating fluctuations of quantum fields to dissipations in the dynamics of spacetime. For the same reason it is shown that dissipation is bound to appear in the dynamics of minisuperspace cosmologies. This provides a natural course for the emergence of a cosmological and thermodynamic arrow of time and suggests a meaningful definition of gravitational entropy. We conclude with a discussion on the criteria for the choice of coarse-grainings and the stability of persistent physical structures.

Flows subject to combined instabilities are also considered, in particular the impingement of opposite-sign vortices on a ground plane.

@article{Xiao2006,
abstract = {This article is concerned with some essential aspects of representative ideas and viewpoints as well as developments in formulations of rate-independent elastoplasticity beyond the small deformation range. Kinematical and physical foundations underlying the basic variables, and the essential constitutive structures implied by the work postulate are examined and discussed, pro and con, from an integrated viewpoint based on certain coherent threads running through various formulations. Their constitutive and computational implications are elucidated and contrasted by analysing the main structural features based on their basic variables. Emphasis is placed on new issues and new understanding, and on physically pertinent variables and formulations. In particular, attention is focused on the essential complexity of elastoplastic fields. It is suggested that residual stress fields attendant upon the removal of external loadings or actions should be indispensable prerequisites for ensuring the geometrical compatibility property of an elastoplastic body as material continuum. A further artificial process of destressing an elastoplastic body would inevitably lead to the loss of its geometrical compatibility and thus to the loss of the kinematical grounds for the usual compatible continuous bodies, such as the loss of the notion of line elements, etc. This might suggest that the elastoplastic deformation should be an inherently inseparable physical entity in the usual sense of compatibility. It is explained that a physically pertinent formulation for the incremental essence of flow-like characteristics of elastoplastic behaviour should be an objective Eulerian formulation based upon the Kirchhoff stress (weighted Cauchy stress) and the natural deformation rate (stretching). According to the latest development, it is possible to establish a straightforward Eulerian rate theory without involving additional ``elastic'' or ``plastic'' deformation-like variables. With so many possibilities in formulating objective Eulerian rate constitutive relations, in particular, for the choices of objective rates among an unlimited number of plausible candidates, it is demonstrated how a unique, self-consistent, general constitutive structure may be derived from two physical consistency criteria by synthesizing and developing a number of essential ideas contributed in previous efforts. With this general self-consistent structure based on Kirchhoff stress and the stretching, it is rigorously found from the work postulate that the normality rule for plastic flow and the convexity property of the yield surface in classical elastoplasticity for the small deformation range may be extended to be general facts even for the case covering the whole deformation range, thus leading to a self-consistent Eulerian rate theory of finite elastoplasticity with the appealingly simple essential structure as in the classical case.},

abstract = {A single crystal plasticity theory for insertion into finite element simulation is formulated using sequential laminates to model subgrain dislocation structures. It is known that local models do not adequately account for latent hardening, as latent hardening is not only a material property, but a nonlocal property (e.g. grain size and shape). The addition of the nonlocal energy from the formation of subgrain structure dislocation walls and the boundary layer misfits provide both latent and self-hardening of a crystal slip. Latent hardening occurs as the formation of new dislocation walls limits motion of new mobile dislocations, thus hardening future slip systems. Self-hardening is accomplished by an evolution of the subgrain structure length scale. The substructure length scale is computed by minimizing the nonlocal energy. The minimization of the nonlocal energy is a competition between the dislocation wall energy and the boundary layer energies. The nonlocal terms are also directly minimized within the subgrain model as they affect deformation response. The geometrical relationship between the dislocation walls and slip planes affecting the dislocation mean free path is taken into account, giving a first- order approximation to shape effects. A coplanar slip model is developed due to requirements while modeling the subgrain structure. This subgrain structure plasticity model is noteworthy as all material parameters are experimentally determined rather than fit. The model also has an inherit path dependence due to the formation of the subgrain structures. Validation is accomplished by comparison with single crystal tension test results.},

abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) was invented to simulate nonaxisymmetric phenomena in astrophysics (Lucy 1977, Gingold {\&} Monaghan 1977). We wanted a method that was easy to work with and could give reasonable accuracy. The SPH method satisfied these require- ments. As a bonus we found the SPH was rugged, gave sensible answers in difficult situations, and could be extended to complicated physics with- out much trouble. The SPH method is a particle method. Unlike the particle in cell method (PIC) (Harlow 1957, 1974, 1988), SPH does not need a grid to calculate spatial derivatives. Instead, they are found by analytical differentiation of interpolation formulae. The equations of momentum and energy become sets of ordinary differential equations which are easy to understand in mechanical and thermodynamical terms. For example, the pressure gradi- ent becomes a force between pairs of particles. The astrophysicist can then use intuition in a way which is difficult with the original partial differential equations. This intuition, coupled with detailed analysis, has allowed SPH to be extended to a wide variety of astrophysical problems. Although very accurate finite-difference methods exist-and these are better than SPH for some problems-they cannot handle complex physics in three dimensions with the same ease. Various aspects of SPH have been reviewed by Monaghan (1985, 1988a) and Benz (1988, 1989).},

abstract = {The possibility of dissipative contributions to the mass flux is considered in detail. A general thermodynami-cally consistent framework is developed to obtain such terms, the compatibility of which with general prin-ciples is then checked—including Galilean invariance, the possibility of steady rigid rotation and uniform center-of-mass motion, the existence of a locally conserved angular momentum, and material objectivity. All previously discussed scenarios of dissipative mass fluxes are found to be ruled out by some combinations of these principles but not a new one that includes a smoothed velocity field v ¯. However, this field v ¯ is nonlocal and leads to unacceptable consequences in specific situations. Hence, we can state with confidence that a dissipative contribution to the mass flux is not possible. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.80.056303 PACS number͑s͒: 47.10.AϪ, 05.70.Ln, 05.20.Jj, 51.10.ϩy I. PROBLEM AND ITS HISTORY The equality of mass flux and momentum density is widely accepted as a statement of plausibility in hydrody-namics supported by countless experiments. However, in a classical paper, Dzyaloshinskii and Volovick ͓1͔ proposed the inclusion of a dissipative mass flux into the hydrody-namic equations. Starting from a modified kinetic theory, Klimontovich ͓2͔ arrived at the same suggestion. More re-cently, a dissipative contribution to the mass flux was rein-troduced and forcefully promoted by Brenner ͓3,4͔, whose work stimulated significant interest and controversy in the physics and fluid dynamics communities. In the early work of Brenner ͓3͔, the mass flux and the momentum density are taken to be equal and only the vol-ume velocity, used in Newton's expression for the stress ten-sor and in no-slip boundary conditions, differs by a dissipa-tive term from the mass velocity ͑see also Brenner's most recent work ͓5͔͒. Brenner's idea has been expanded in ͓6͔, where not only Newton's expression for the stress tensor but also Fourier's law for the heat flux has been modified. These methods yield some elements, e.g., thermal stresses, which are known in kinetic theory of gases as rarefaction effects, which only play a role beyond the hydrodynamic regime, that is, at finite Knudsen numbers. Indeed, extensions of hydrodynamics to the finite Knud-sen numbers are widely discussed within kinetic theory ͑e.g., Burnett equations, R13 equations, extended thermodynamics ͓7͔͒; none of these includes dissipative contributions to mass flux, and all reduce to classical hydrodynamics in the limit of small Knudsen numbers. The modifications to hydrodynam-ics in ͓3,6͔ are not able to produce the whole wealth of rarefaction effects known in the kinetic theory. Moreover, to our knowledge, they were never tested successfully against solutions of the Boltzmann equation or experiments. Greenshields and Reese ͓8,9͔ used Brenner's equations of both scenarios ͓3,4͔ to describe experimental findings for the structure of shock waves. In their work, the modified hydro-dynamic equations are actually considered as the simplest way of introducing finite Knudsen number effects ͓7͔. How-ever, the equations should be subjected to a much wider ar-ray of test problems at small and finite Knudsen numbers before one can claim that they give meaningful results. Be-cause we are interested in hydrodynamic theories introducing a difference between mass flux and momentum density, how-ever, we do not discuss the ideas of ͓3,6͔ any further. In an unpublished precursor version of ͓3͔, dated October 30, 2002, Brenner actually proposed a difference between mass flux and momentum density, which is the topic of the present work. He later returned to this original idea in ͓4͔, with a specific recommendation for the cross coupling of density and temperature effects based on his " incompress-ibility hypothesis. " Brenner's work motivated thorough investigations on the thermodynamic admissibility of a dissipative contribution to the mass flux ͓10–14͔, which demonstrated that the idea fits naturally into the " general equation for the nonequilibrium reversible-irreversible coupling " ͑GENERIC͒ framework and into standard linear irreversible thermodynamics. However, these investigations focused entirely on nonequilibrium ther-modynamics and neglected other equally important consid-erations, such as the local conservation of angular momen-tum. Such additional criteria were considered earlier in ͓15͔ and corroborated the original ͑not rigorously justified͒ state-ment of Landau and Lifshitz that mass flux and momentum density must be equal ͑see footnote at the end of Sec. 49 of ͓16͔͒. A concise summary of the current state of the discus-sion can be found in the comment ͓17͔ to the letter ͓14͔ and in the reply ͓18͔ to that comment. To obtain a more complete picture, we here first develop a general thermodynamically consistent scenario of hydrody-namics with dissipative mass flux and then apply the follow-ing additional criteria: Galilean invariance, possibility of steady rigid fluid rotation, existence of a locally conserved},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) was originally proposed for simulating atmospheric flows in the 1960s and has become one of the most promising and successful methodology for simulating turbulent flows with the improvement of computing power. It is now feasible to simulate complex engineering flows using LES. However, apart from the computing power, significant challenges still remain for LES to reach a level of maturity that brings this approach to the mainstream of engineering and industrial computations. This paper will describe briefly LES formalism first, present a quick glance at its history, review its current state focusing mainly on its applications in transitional flows and gas turbine combustor flows, discuss some major modelling and numerical challenges/issues that we are facing now and in the near future, and finish with the concluding remarks.},

Both functionals mimic (and for small deformations approximate) the classical Kirchhoff–St Venant materials but differ in the strain variable used.

abstract = {Abstract: Theory of elasticity in topological insulators has many common features with relativistic quantum fields interacting with gravitational fields in the tetrad form. Here we discuss several issues in the effective topological (pseudo)electromagnetic response in three-dimensional weak crystalline topological insulators with no time-reversal symmetry that feature elasticity tetrads, including a mixed “axial-gravitational” anomaly. This response has some resemblance to “quasitopological” terms proposed for massless Weyl quasiparticles with separate, emergent fermion tetrads. As an example, we discuss the chiral/axial anomaly in superfluid 3 He-A. We demonstrate the principal difference between the elasticity tetrads and the Weyl fermion tetrads in the construction of the topological terms in the action. In particular, the topological action expressed in terms of the elasticity tetrads cannot be expressed in terms of the Weyl fermion tetrads since in this case the gauge invariance is lost.},
